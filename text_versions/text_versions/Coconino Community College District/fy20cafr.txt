November 30, 2020 

To the Residents of Coconino County Community College District: 

The Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) of the Coconino County Community 
College District (the District) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 is a detailed look at how 
Coconino Community College operates. 

Arizona Revised Statutes (A.R.S.) §41-1279.07 requires community college districts of Arizona to 
prepare an annual budgeted expenditure limitation report and annual financial statements 
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Auditor General or a 
certified public accountant performing the annual audit shall attest to the expenditure limitation 
report and financial statements. This report is published to fulfill the requirements for the annual 
financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. The expenditure limitation report is 
published separately. 

Responsibility for both the accuracy of the data and the completeness and fairness of the  
presentation, including all disclosures, rests with the District. To the best of our knowledge and 
belief, the enclosed data is accurate in all material respects and is reported in a manner designed 
to present fairly the financial position and results of operations of the District. All disclosures 
necessary to enable the reader to gain an understanding of the District’s financial status and 
activities have been included. 

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal controls designed to ensure 
that assets are protected from loss, theft, or misuse, and to ensure that adequate accounting data 
is compiled to allow for the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles. No matter how well internal controls are designed, they can only 
provide reasonable assurance that objectives have been achieved. 

Audit services are provided by the Arizona Office of the Auditor General. As noted above, 
Arizona Revised Statutes require an annual audit of the District’s financial statements. This 
requirement has been complied with. The independent auditors’ report is included in this 
document. The auditors’ opinion is unmodified. 

This letter of transmittal is designed to complement the Management’s Discussion & Analysis
(located in the Financial Section of this document) and should be read in conjunction with it. 

Reporting Entity 

The District is an independent reporting entity within the criteria established by generally accepted 
accounting principles (GAAP) as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board 
(GASB). Although the District shares the same geographic boundaries of Coconino County, 
financial accountability for all activities related to public community college education in Coconino 
County is exercised solely by the District. In accordance with GASB Statement No. 61, the 
financial reporting entity consists of a primary government and a component unit. Coconino 
County Community College District is a primary government because  it is a special-purpose  
government that has a separately elected governing body, is legally separate, and is fiscally 
independent of other state and local governments. The financial activity of the Coconino 
Community College Foundation is presented as a component unit of the District. The District is 
not included in any other governmental financial reporting entity. 

Profile of Coconino County Community College District 

As a political subdivision of the State of Arizona, the Coconino County Community College District 
is subject to the oversight of the District’s Governing Board (the Board), which is comprised of five 
elected members, representing each of the five precincts of the County. These members are

elected for six-year terms on a staggered basis. The Board is granted full authority from the 
Arizona Revised Statutes to manage the business and educational needs of the District. The 
administrative staff is responsible for the daily operation of the District. 

The District exercises primary property tax levy authority for generation of funds for operating 
expenses. State appropriations are also received based on Full Time Student Equivalent (FTSE) 
enrollment and formula funding. One FTSE equals 15 credit hours each from both fall and spring 
semesters, for a total of 30 credit hours for one year. 

Coconino Community College faculty and staff help to promote an environment of excellence to 
support our students. The District has helped create the region’s skilled workforce, with the goal 
of improving the lives of our residents through workforce development and higher education. The 
District serves approximately 6,200 students a year currently, and has served over 85,000 
students county-wide since opening the doors. The number of students served in the current year 
is down due to the impacts of COVID-19. The District provides affordable tuition and a wide 
variety of certificates and degrees including career/technical programs with nearly 50 certificate 
programs and two-year associate degrees in various fields including nursing, fire science, law 
enforcement and business. Many credit hours are delivered via alternative delivery methods 
including online, hybrid, and ITV, or at alternative times or places. The District offers Dual 
Enrollment, Programs of Study, CAVIAT and concurrent enrollment programs to jump start high 
schools students’ higher education goals. The CCC2NAU and other university transfer programs 
offer a seamless transition to a four-year institution. 

The District is an accredited institution of the Higher Learning Commission (HLC). The HLC 
evaluation process assures quality by verifying an institution meets standards and is engaged in 
continuous improvement. It includes annual monitoring of both financial and non-financial 
indicators and ensures the organization adheres to HLC policies and practices on institutional 
change. 

The District serves the educational needs of Coconino County through three facilities: the       
Flagstaff Lone Tree Campus and District Offices, the Flagstaff Fourth Street Innovation Center, 
and the Page/Lake Powell Instructional Site. In addition, The District partners with high schools 
throughout the County to provide services including those at Grand Canyon, Tuba City, Fredonia, 
and Williams. District-wide administrative and support services are centralized and administered 
by the President and the respective Vice-Presidents and Deans. 

The District embraces the philosophy of shared governance, which is  the process by  which the  
college community, including administration, employees, students and public when appropriate, 
respectfully share responsibility for reaching collective decisions on issues related to the District. 
This governance model includes two functional Councils (Business and Administrative, and 
Academic Affairs and Student Development) that provide oversight for departmental and cross-
departmental initiatives. The Executive Leadership Council makes decisions based on functional 
Council recommendations and provides recommendations to the Board when necessary. 

History 

In November of 1990, the citizens of Coconino County established the District under the 
provisions of legislation enacted by the Arizona State Legislature in 1971. In May 1991, the 
District’s funding was approved through special election, and operations began on July 1, 1991. 
The District boundaries are conterminous with the boundaries of Coconino County. 

When the District first opened its doors, nearly 1,000 students enrolled at the Flagstaff campus in 
the first semester. Since then, the District has experienced an astounding growth rate and today 
serves, more than 6,200 students per year. 

In June of 1992 the District began the process of seeking affiliation with the Commission on 
Institutions of Higher Education of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. In 
1996 the District received initial accreditation from the Commission on Institutions of Higher

Education. The first commencement was held in 1993 with three graduates. 

Student Population 

Coconino Community College serves a diverse population of students each year. Most are 
seeking a degree or certificate, 53 percent are female, and nearly 13 percent are high school 
students earning college credit.

Coconino County is located in the northern portion of the State and encompasses an area of 
approximately 12 million acres. Its boundaries include the cities of Page, Fredonia, Tuba City, 
Grand Canyon, Williams, Sedona, and Flagstaff, as well as other smaller cities and towns, and all 
the unincorporated areas of the County. The County's 2010 population was 134,421 by the U.S. 
Census Bureau. 

With 18,661 square miles, Coconino County is the second largest county in the United States and 
the largest in Arizona, but is one of the most sparsely populated. It is characterized by rugged 
mountains, deep canyons and thick forests of pine, spruce, aspen and oak. Within its borders are 
many scenic sites – the most popular and impressive is Grand Canyon National Park. Other 
attractions are Oak Creek Canyon, Sunset Crater National Monument, prehistoric Indian ruins at 
Wupatki, Walnut Canyon, the Navajo National Monument, the San Francisco Peaks - Arizona’s 
highest point at 12,633 feet, and Lake Powell with 1,960 miles of shoreline. 

Tribal Lands comprise 39.1 percent of the County and are home to the Navajo, Hopi, Paiute, 
Havasupai, and Hualapai tribes. The U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management 
control 32.3 percent of the land; the state of Arizona owns 9.4 percent; the National Park 
Services controls 6.9 percent; and the remaining 12.3 percent is owned by individuals or 
corporations. 

Local Economy 

The share of the County's labor force is heavily weighted towards government, trade, and service 
employment. Relative to the rest of the state, the work force employed by government is high at 
28% of the workforce. Part of the reasons for the large number of government workers in the 
County include the presence of several major national parks, Tribal Lands and the high 
percentage of public lands in the county. 

Coconino County and Arizona tend to have higher unemployment rates than the national 
average. The County unemployment rate as of August 2020 (6.0%) is above the state (5.9%) but 
not the national level (7.6%). The state and national rates are higher than previous years due to

the impact of the pandemic on employment and the economy overall. And with the exception of 
one-time rural college funding received in the current fiscal year, the District must contend with 
the continued limited funding from the State due to defunding of over 40% of State aid in the past 
twelve years. The District is committed to improving and offering additional services to meet the 
County needs. These efforts are achieved through careful monitoring of costs, innovative 
partnerships, cost saving opportunities, and seeking new revenue sources. 

Long Term Strategic Financial and Operational Planning 

Financial Reporting 

The Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) for the District was formulated with data 
from several sources. These statements present information on the financial condition of the 
District and whether resources were adequate to cover the costs of providing services during the 
reporting period. The District's CAFR is distributed to the District Governing Board and executive  
management, the State legislature, Federal and State agencies, and financial institutions as well 
as others throughout the general public. Internal management reports are customized and 
provided to meet the information and decision-making needs at all levels of the organization to 
aid management in the allocation of resources. 

Financial Indicators 

Coconino Community College reports financial information with the HLC, the District’s accrediting 
body. The HLC collects financial indicators to evaluate reserve strength, operating revenues, 
viability, and return on net assets. In addition, the HLC ratios lead to a composite financial index, 
which is a weighted average score to determine the overall financial health of the organization. 
The ratio shown here reflects the impact of the Government Accounting Standards Board 
(GASB) Statement 68, Accounting & Financial Reporting for Pensions, and Statement 75, 
Accounting & Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions. Through 
strategic and financial planning efforts, the District has been able to improve its composite  
financial index score over the past ten years and for FY2019* exceeded the 3.0 benchmark once 
again with a composite score of 7.7.

Budget 

The District is required to prepare an all funds balanced budget each fiscal year on report forms 
prescribed by the Arizona Office of the Auditor General for public inspection. The District 
maintains budgetary controls by line item of the approved budget. Budget transfers are restricted 
to function and object. The objective of these budgetary controls is to ensure compliance with the 
annual budget adopted by the Board. The legal level of budgetary control is by summary line item 
of the current and plant funds. 

Budgetary compliance is also demonstrated with the issuance of an annual budgeted expenditure 
limitation report, which is also audited. Calculation and compliance with an expenditure limitation 
is an Arizona constitutional requirement for local taxing entities, and the purpose is to control 
expenditures and limit future increases in spending adjustments for inflation, deflation, population 
growth of counties, cities, and towns, and student population growth of community college 
districts. 

An encumbrance accounting system is maintained by the District as one technique of 
accomplishing budgetary control. Open encumbrances are not reported as reservations of fund 
balance at year end, but are liquidated (lapse at year end). Encumbrances are re-established at 
the beginning of the next fiscal year as an obligation against the current year’s adopted budget. 

As part of the FY2018 budget development process, the District added a budget hearing process 
that expanded financial literacy and transparency. Open meetings were implemented so that all 
employees could participate in the budget development process, from the budget kick-off through 
budget hearings where budget increment requests were presented for evaluation. The result is 
greater transparency for faculty, staff, and students on how resources are allocated to best 
support learning. 

Debt Administration 

The District does not foresee any debt in the near future. 

Long-term Financial Planning 

Coconino Community College has both the lowest property tax rate of all Arizona community  
colleges, and dwindling State funding as a percentage of the budget. The District continuously 
monitors revenues and expenditures, and adjusts program levels to maintain long-term financial 
stability. As shown below, long-term planning has resulted in revenues and expenses in balance 
for a ten-year horizon.

Student Progress and Outcomes Reporting 

In 2010, the presidents of all ten of the Arizona community college districts worked together to 
develop long-term performance measures called Vision 2020. (This has recently been 
renamed to Vision 2030.) The document identified 30 key indicators to measure progress
toward three critical goals of access, retention, and completion. Many of the key indicators 
within each goal area are based on the American Association of Community Colleges 
Voluntary Framework of Accountability (VFA). The VFA created common measures by which 
community colleges can be held accountable including student progress, outcomes, workforce, 
economic, and community development metrics. 

The performance measures and baseline data were published in February 2011. The Arizona 
colleges have since reported on the metrics for 2012 through 2019 and now have eight years 
of trend data. The District uses these performance measures to drive the development of the 
strategic plan and budget. The District selected various measures to focus on for improvement,
and set target goals for annual improvement. The measures depicted below show the target 
goals the District selected for improvement through the strategic plan and resource allocation 
process.

Major Initiatives 

CCC2NAU 

In collaboration with Northern Arizona University (NAU), the District developed a unique   
partnership known as the CCC2NAU program. This award winning program helps students earn 
their CCC associate degree and transition from CCC to NAU seamlessly to earn a bachelor’s 
degree. Advisors are trained in academic offerings and degree requirements across both 
institutions, and over 90 degree plans have been created that quickly identify courses at the 
community college that articulate to a designated major at NAU. 

Program features include: 
 Waived NAU application fee ($25) and an NAU ID card 
 Automatic transfer of credits and seamless exchange of transcripts 
 Personalized advising with tailored degree plans while at CCC 
 Assistance in transitioning to the university 
 Access to many services, such as the NAU library, computer lab, and campus events 
 Dedicated scholarships for CCC2NAU students at both NAU and CCC 
 Option to live on the NAU campus, purchase a meal plan and join the health and recreation 

center 

The CCC2NAU program began with the Fall 2008 term with an initial cohort of 15 students. Since 
then 4,593 have participated in the program and 703 have graduated from NAU. 

Workforce Development and STEM 

The District has initiated a concentrated effort over the past several years to provide communities 
with more occupational and technical training. As a result of voter approved Proposition 301 that 
was passed in 2000, the State of Arizona imposed a 0.6% sales tax to assist in this effort. The 
use of these funds is restricted to workforce development programs, such as the nursing program, 
computer information systems, and construction technology management. To meet the unique 
interests of individuals and groups within the service area of the District, customized workforce 
training services were developed. District graduates are a large part of the local workforce, with 
many registered nurses, paramedics, firefighters, and police officers trained here. 

The State of Arizona allocates additional funding to community colleges to support Science, 
Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) and Workforce Programs. This allocation

AUDITOR GENERAL AUDITOR GENERAL DEPUTY AUDITOR GENERAL 

Independent auditors’ report 

Members of the Arizona State Legislature 

The Governing Board of 
Coconino County Community College District 

Report on the financial statements 

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the business-type activities and discretely 
presented component unit of the Coconino County Community College District as of and for the year ended 
June 30, 2020, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the District’s 
basic financial statements as listed in the table of contents. 

Management’s responsibility for the financial statements 

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in 
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; this includes the design, implementation, 
and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements 
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

Auditors’ responsibility 

Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on our audit. We did not audit 
the financial statements of the discretely presented component unit. Those statements were audited by 
other auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts 
included for the discretely presented component unit, is based solely on the other auditors’ report. We 
conducted our audit in accordance with U.S. generally accepted auditing standards and the standards 
applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller 
General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. The other 
auditors did not audit the discretely presented component unit’s financial statements in accordance with 
Government Auditing Standards. 

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors’ judgment, including the assessment 
of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making 
those risk assessments, the auditors consider internal control relevant to the District’s preparation and fair 
presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal 
control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of 
accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by 
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. 

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
audit opinions.

Opinions 

In our opinion, based on our audit and the report of the other auditors, the financial statements referred to 
above present fairly, in all material respects, the respective financial position of the business-type activities 
and discretely presented component unit of the District as of June 30, 2020, and the respective changes in 
financial position and, where applicable, cash flows thereof for the year then ended in accordance with U.S. 
generally accepted accounting principles. 

Other matters 

Required supplementary information 

U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that the management’s discussion and analysis on 
pages 21 through 31, schedule of the District’s proportionate share of the net pension liability on page 64, 
schedule of the District’s pension contributions on page 65, and schedule of District’s changes in total OPEB 
liability on page 67 be presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information, although 
not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board, 
who considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an 
appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures to the 
required supplementary information in accordance with U.S. generally accepted auditing standards, which 
consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the 
information for consistency with management’s responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, 
and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express an 
opinion or provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with 
sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance. 

Other information 

Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively 
comprise the District's basic financial statements. The introductory and statistical sections listed in the table 
of contents are presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not required parts of the basic financial 
statements. 

The introductory and statistical sections have not been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the 
audit of the basic financial statements, and accordingly, we do not express an opinion or provide any 
assurance on them. 

Other reporting required by Government Auditing Standards 

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated November 30, 
2020, on our consideration of the District’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its 
compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. 
The purpose of that report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial 
reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness 
of the District’s internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an 
audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the District’s internal 
control over financial reporting and compliance.

Coconino County Community College District 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis 

Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2020 

Our discussion and analysis of the District’s financial performance provides an overview of the 
District’s financial activities for the year ended June 30, 2020. Please read it in conjunction with 
the transmittal letter, which precedes this section, and the financial statements, which immediately 
follow. 

Using This Annual Report 

The District’s financial statements are presented in accordance with pronouncements issued by
the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB), the authoritative body for establishing 
generally accepted accounting principles for state and local governments, including public 
institutions of higher education. These pronouncements permit public colleges and universities to 
use the guidance for special-purpose governments, engaged only in business-type activities, in 
their separately issued financial statements. As such, the reader will observe that the presentation 
format is a consolidated, single-column format, similar to the type of financial statements one might 
encounter from a typical business enterprise or a not-for-profit organization. The basic financial 
statements consist of the following: 

The Statement of Net Position reflects the financial position of the District at June 30, 2020. It 
shows the assets owned or controlled, deferred outflows of resources, related liabilities and other 
obligations, deferred inflows of resources, and the categories of net position. Net position is an 
accounting concept defined as total assets and deferred outflows of resources less total liabilities 
and deferred inflows of resources, and as such, represents the institutional equity or ownership in 
the total assets of the District. 

From the data presented, readers of the Statement of Net Position are able to determine the 
assets available to continue operations of the District. They are also able to determine how much 
the District owes vendors and investors. Finally, the Statement of Net Position provides a picture of
the net position and its availability for expenditure by the District. 

Net position is divided into three major categories. The first category, net investment in capital    
assets provides the District’s equity in property, plant, and equipment owned by the District. The 
next category is restricted net position, which is expendable. Expendable restricted net position is 
available for expenditure by the District but must be spent solely for the purpose of their restriction. 
The final category is unrestricted net position, which is available to the District for any lawful 
purpose of the District. 

The Statement of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Position reflects the results of 
operations and other changes for the year ended June 30, 2020. It shows the revenues and 
expenses, both operating and nonoperating, reconciling the beginning net position amount to the 
ending net position amount, which is shown on the Statement of Net Position described above. 

Generally speaking, operating revenues are received for providing goods and services to the 
customers and constituencies of the District. Operating expenses are those expenses paid to 
acquire or produce the goods and services provided in return for the operating revenues and to 
carry out the mission of the District. Nonoperating revenues are revenues received for which goods 
and services are not provided. For example, State appropriations are nonoperating because they 
are provided by the Legislature to the District without the Legislature directly receiving
commensurate goods and services for those revenues. 

The Statement of Cash Flows reflects the inflows and outflows of cash and cash equivalents for  
the year ended June 30, 2020. It shows the cash activities by type, reconciling the beginning cash 
and cash equivalents amount to the ending cash and cash equivalents amount, which is shown on 
the Statement of Net Position, described above. In addition, this statement reconciles cash flows 
used for operating activities to the operating loss shown on the Statement of Revenues, Expenses, 
and Changes in Net Position, described above

Management’s Discussion and Analysis 

Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2020 

Financial Highlights and Analysis 

Statement of Net Position 

Total net position for the Coconino County Community College District increased by
$1,532,374, or 4.2%, from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020. This increase was primarily a 
result of increased state appropriations (one-time funding) and greater private contracts.  

Current assets increased by 9.2% with the largest increase in cash and investments. The 
increase in net position due to additional state appropriations created a net cash inflow that is 
being invested until the best use of these one-time funds can be determined. Capital assets 
decreased by 0.1% due to depreciation expense in excess of new capital additions. Deferred 
outflows of resources decreased by 33.2% overall from the previous year’s balance. The 
decrease in the current year is due to the difference between the District’s pension’s expected 
and actual experience, as well as changes in assumptions, changes in proportion between 
contributions and proportionate share of contributions, and the District’s contributions 
subsequent to the measurement date. By contrast, deferred outflows for the District’s  
postemployment benefit plans (OPEB) increased, primarily as a result of differences between 
expected and actual experience and changes in assumptions.  

Other liabilities increased 3.4% due to increases in pre-paid fall tuition revenue and accrued 
compensation at year-end. Long-term liabilities also increased, by 4.0%, primarily due to 
increases in pension liability. Deferred inflows of resources decreased 38.5% mostly due to 
changes in assumptions and lower levels of projected and actual earnings on the pension plan 
investments. More detail on FY2020 assets, deferred outflows of resources, liabilities, and 
deferred inflows of resources can be found on the Statement of Net Position. 

Many other factors are responsible for the net position increase, which are identified in the 
discussion of the Statement of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Position, below. 

Statement of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Position 

The District has four major revenue sources that account for 90.4% of revenues. These are 
tuition and fees, property taxes, state appropriations, and government grants and contracts. 
Total revenue for the District increased $220 thousand, or 0.9%, in fiscal year 2020 from the 
fiscal year 2019 total. Operating revenues increased by 13.3% due to tuition changes and a 
private grant from the Del E. Webb Foundation.   Nonoperating revenues decreased 3.2% due 
to a decrease in property taxes. Additionally, a capital gift was recorded in 2019. Changes in 
each revenue source are described below: 

 Tuition and fees (net of scholarship allowances) increased $37 thousand, or 0.6%. 
The increase is due to the addition of an out-of-county/district tuition rate that is 
higher than the in-county rate. 

 Private contracts increased $892 thousand, or 407.1%. This increase is primarily 
due to the receipt of a nearly $1 million grant from the Del E. Webb Foundation to 
the CCC Foundation for the District’s Construction and Technology Programs. The 
project is still in progress as of year-end but the bulk of the funds were spent in 
FY2020. In addition, the Small Business Development Center (SBDC) program,
which began halfway through FY2018 and incorporates government and private 
funding, continues to grow. 

 The College collects a percentage of sales from the Bookstore through a contract 
with a third-party vendor. Bookstore income decreased $9 thousand, or 12.4%, for

Coconino County Community College District 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis 

Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2020 

FY2020. This trend has been ongoing for several years due to a continued rise in 
competition from online retailers. An additional factor this year was COVID-19 
which forced the closure of the bookstore to casual sales for some time during the 
spring term. 

 Auxiliary enterprises revenue fell nearly $5 thousand or 21.8% from FY2019. 
Vending commissions were down due to the campus lockdown in the spring term. 

 Other operating revenue decreased $18 thousand, or 8.1% from FY2019 due to 
fewer receipts from parking revenue and facilities use fees as a result of the campus 
closures from COVID-19 in the spring term. 

 Property taxes decreased over $2 million, or 18.9%. This is directly attributable to 
the cessation of secondary property taxes levied to fund the debt that was paid off in 
full in FY2019.   

 State appropriations increased $941 thousand, or 43.5%, due to the one-time rural 
funding received from the state of over $1 million.   

 Government grants increased $467 thousand, or 10.5%. This is primarily due to the 
Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and 
Economic Security (CARES) Act) granted to the District in March as part of the 
COVID-19 response and stimulus. Much of these funds, $552 thousand, were 
directly granted to students to assist their additional needs during the pandemic.   

 Workforce development funding from State sales taxes increased $34 thousand, or 
6.4% from 2019 and is based on a percentage of taxable sales. 

 Investment earnings increased $12 thousand, or 2.5%, due to an increase in the 
average balance invested. 

 The District recorded a gain on disposal of capital assets of just over $2 thousand 
from the sale of a vehicle and equipment. This is $8 thousand less than the prior 
year, or a decrease of 75.9%. 

Total operating expenses increased by $1.712 million, or 7.7%, from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal 
year 2020. The primary reasons for the increase relate to adjustments in FY2020 to record 
pension and postemployment benefit costs and compensation increases which were primarily
cost of living increases. Additional changes by expense classification are as follows: 

 Instruction expenses increased $772 thousand, or 12.7%. This was primarily due to 
new faculty hires as well as additional expenses related to teaching delivery method 
changes due to COVID-19.  

 Public service expenses increased by $55 thousand, or 56.0%, as the SBDC and  
other public service programs continued to expand. The SBDC program also 
received some CARES Act funds in the current year. 

 Academic support expenses decreased $186 thousand, or 5.0%. There were 
decreases in supplies, fixed charges and travel primarily related to reduced 
expenses due to COVID-19 and the campus lockdowns. Additionally, some 
positions were reclassified to Student services.

Coconino County Community College District 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis 

Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2020 

 Student services expenses increased $802 thousand, or 26.5%. This increase was 
primarily a result of certain positions being reclassified from Academic or 
Institutional support as well as additional expenses related to COVID-19. 

 Institutional support expenses decreased $108 thousand, or 2.5% from FY2019. 
Some of the decrease was a result of reclassification of positions and some a result 
of hiring in the prior year being higher than usual due to overlap in personnel during 
retirement transitions. 

 Operation and maintenance of plant expenses increased $48 thousand, or 2.9% 
due to increases in compensation. There were also some increases to contracted 
services and supplies, mostly a result of having to adjust the facilities to the 
pandemic. 

 Scholarship expense increased, net of scholarship allowances, $269 thousand, or 
13.3% due, in large part, to emergency funds granted to students through the 
Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund from the CARES Act.  

 Auxiliary enterprises expenses decreased $5 thousand, or 15.9%, due to the 
campus lockdowns and lack of personnel on campus for casual sales. 

Capital Asset and Debt Administration 

Capital assets are defined as those items costing over $5,000 and which have a normal useful 
life of more than one year. The District has created renewal and replacement (R&R)        
schedules for all of its facilities, as well as technology. The schedules are updated annually 
and funds are invested and designated for this purpose. As of June 30, 2020, these funds 
amounted to approximately $5.3 million. 

Below is a summary of the capital assets, net of depreciation, as of June 30: 

At this time, the District does not have any debt and does not plan on acquiring any debt in the 
near future.

Current Factors Having Probable Future Financial Significance 

The community college system-wide appropriation for state aid is provided by A.R.S. §15-1466. The for-
mula is based on the current base and enrollment growth. During the past decade state aid to community 
colleges was cut drastically. Although state aid funding of $3,130,800 represented 45.8% of total revenues 
in fiscal year 2001, fiscal year 2020 state aid operational funding, which excludes state STEM allocations 
and one-time rural funding, of $1,703,400 only represents 6.7% of total revenues. State aid operational 
funding for fiscal year 2021 is appropriated at $1,698,400, a decrease from FY2020. Due to this historical  
funding trend, and the recent elimination of urban funding, it is anticipated the trend of declining aid may 
continue. The District has incorporated state aid funding loss projections into its long-term planning sce-
narios and has developed a plan to balance the budget with future funding reductions. To accommodate 
the decline in state aid, tuition has increased from $33 per credit hour in fiscal year 2001 to $111 per credit 
hour in fiscal year 2020, a 236% increase over this twenty-year period. 

As noted, in FY2020, the state approved a one-time appropriation for rural community colleges, awarding 
each college a set amount. The District received an additional $1,003,100 in funding which it plans to car-
ry forward over the next three years. The funds will be used as seed money for new programs which, if 
successful, will be continued and will provide additional revenue streams for the College. 

The long-term impact of the closing of the Navajo Generating Station near Page is still uncertain but, in the 
short-term, the District is no longer receiving in lieu taxes related to the Salt River Project. Ultimately, 
property and sales taxes are likely to decline as well. Subsequent to year-end, the Transwestern Pipeline 
Company LLC court case has received a stipulated judgment. See note 12 of the basic financial state-
ments for details. The reduced assessment, which will result in a reversal of property taxes previously as-
sessed to Transwestern Pipeline, will impact the overall property taxes available for the county and, ulti-
mately, are likely to reduce property taxes received by the District.  

Through a generous $1 million grant given to the Foundation from the Del E. Webb Foundation, the Col-
lege has expanded and updated its construction technology spaces at the Fourth Street campus. This 
project, expected to be completed in FY2021, will allow for additional training facilities for students and ad-
ditional trades offerings as well. 

Changes to both the Arizona and Flagstaff minimum wage rates will continue to impact the hours the Col-
lege can pay for student wage positions. Future increases will also create pressure on the College’s salary 
structure, leading to higher compensation costs. 

COVID-19 

The impact of the pandemic that struck the United States in March of 2020 is ongoing. It has created un-
certainty about many of the most basic operations of the District. Enrollment, teaching methods, staffing, 
facilities, and student satisfaction are the most obvious areas impacted but, in reality, every area has been 
touched by the changes brought about by the lockdowns, economic factors, required compliance, and the
illness itself.   We can anticipate continued and likely increased cuts to state appropriations and declines in 
property and sales taxes received. How this will impact future staffing and student offerings is unknown. 
Budgeting within these constraints has truly been a challenge and will continue to be for some time.   

Additional information on the financial impact of COVID-19 on the District’s finances can be found in Note 
11 of the basic financial statements.

Coconino County Community College District 
Notes to Financial Statements 

June 30, 2020 

 Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  

Coconino County Community College District’s accounting policies conform to generally 
accepted accounting principles applicable to public institutions engaged only in business-
type activities adopted by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). 

A. Reporting Entity 

The District is a special-purpose government that a separately elected governing body 
governs. It is legally separate and fiscally independent of other state and local 
governments. The accompanying financial statements present the activities of the District 
(the primary government) and its discretely presented component unit, the Coconino 
Community College Foundation (Foundation). 

The Coconino Community College Foundation is a legally separate, tax-exempt 
organization. It acts primarily as a fund-raising organization that receives gifts and 
bequests, administers those resources, and disburses payments to or on behalf of the 
District for scholarships and support of District programs. Although the District does not 
control the timing or amount of receipts from the Foundation, the Foundation’s restricted 
resources can be used only by or for the benefit of the District or its constituents. 
Consequently, the Foundation is considered a component unit of the District and is 
discretely presented in the District’s financial statements. 

For financial reporting purposes, the Foundation follows the Financial Accounting
Standards Board statements for not-for-profit organizations. As such, certain revenue 
recognition criteria and presentation features are different from GASB revenue recognition
criteria and presentation features. No modifications have been made to the Foundation’s 
financial information included in the District’s financial report. Accordingly, those financial 
statements have been reported on separate pages following the District’s respective 
counterpart financial statements. For financial reporting purposes, only the Foundation’s 
statements of financial position and activities are included in the District’s financial 
statements as required by generally accepted accounting principles for public colleges and 
universities. The Foundation has a June 30 year-end. 

During the year ended June 30, 2020, the Foundation distributed $1,008,520 to the District 
for both restricted and unrestricted purposes. Complete financial statements for the 
Foundation can be obtained from the CCC Foundation Office, Coconino County 
Community College District, 2800 S. Lone Tree Road, Flagstaff, AZ 86005. 

B. Basis of Presentation and Accounting 

The financial statements include a statement of net position; a statement of revenues, 
expenses, and changes in net position; and a statement of cash flows. 

A statement of net position provides information about the District’s assets, deferred 
outflows of resources, liabilities, deferred inflows of resources, and net position at the end 
of the year. Assets and liabilities are classified as either current or noncurrent. Net position 
is classified according to external donor restrictions or availability of assets to satisfy the 
District’s obligations. Net investment in capital assets represents the value of capital      
assets, net of accumulated depreciation, less any outstanding debt incurred to acquire or 
construct the assets. Expendable restricted net position represents grants, contracts, gifts, 
and other resources that have been externally restricted for specific purposes. Unrestricted 
net position consists of all other resources, including those that have been designated by 
management to be used for other than general operating purposes.

Coconino County Community College District 
Notes to Financial Statements 

June 30, 2020 

 Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

A statement of revenues, expenses, and changes in net position provides information 
about the District’s financial activities during the year. Revenues and expenses are 
classified as either operating or non-operating, and all changes in net position are reported, 
including capital contributions. Operating revenues and expenses generally result from 
exchange transactions. Accordingly, revenues such as tuition and bookstore, in which each 
party receives and gives up essentially equal values are considered operating revenues. 
Other revenues, such as property taxes, state appropriations, and government grants, 
result from transactions in which the parties do not exchange equal values and are 
considered non-operating revenues. Operating expenses include the cost of sales and 
services, administrative expenses, and depreciation on capital assets. Other expenses, 
such as interest expense, are considered non-operating expenses. 

A statement of cash flows provides information about the District’s sources and uses of 
cash and cash equivalents during the year. Increases and decreases in cash and cash 
equivalents are classified as either operating, noncapital financing, capital financing, or 
investing. 

The financial statements are presented using the economic resources measurement focus 
and the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recorded when earned, and expenses 
are recorded at the time liabilities are incurred, regardless of when the related cash flows 
take place. Property taxes are recognized as revenue in the year for which they are levied. 
State appropriations are recognized as revenue in the year in which the appropriation is 
first made available for use. Grants and donations are recognized as revenue as soon as 
all eligibility requirements the provider imposed have been met. Internal activity is 
eliminated using a charge-back method, charging user departments, and reducing 
expenses in the department providing the service. It is the District’s policy to first apply 
restricted resources when an expense is incurred for purposes when both restricted and 
unrestricted net positions are available.  

C. Cash and Investments 

For the statement of cash flows, the District’s cash and cash equivalents are considered to 
be cash on hand, cash and investments held by the County Treasurer, and investments in 
the State Treasurer’s Local Government Investment Pool. All investments are stated at fair 
value. 

D. Inventories 

The supplies inventory is stated at cost by specific identification. 

E. Capital Assets 

Capital assets are reported at actual cost. Donated assets are reported at acquisition 
value. 

Capitalization thresholds (the dollar values above which asset acquisitions are added to 
the capital asset accounts), depreciation methods, and estimated useful lives of capital
assets are as follows:

E. Capital Assets (continued) 

The asset class for buildings also includes building improvements. 

F. Deferred Outflows and Inflows of Resources 

The statement of net position includes separate sections for deferred outflows of resources 
and deferred inflows of resources. Deferred outflows of resources represent a 
consumption of net position that applies to future periods that will be recognized as an 
expense in future periods. Deferred inflows of resources represent an acquisition of net 
position that applies to future periods and will be recognized as a revenue in future periods. 

G. Postemployment Benefits 

For purposes of measuring the net pension and other postemployment benefits (OPEB) 
liabilities, deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources related to 
pensions and OPEB, and pension and OPEB expense, information about the plans’
fiduciary net position and additions to/deductions from the plans’ fiduciary net position have 
been determined on the same basis as they are reported by the plans. For this purpose, 
benefit payments (including refunds of employee contributions) are recognized when due 
and payable in accordance with the benefit terms.  Investments are reported at fair value. 

H. Investment Earnings 

Investment earnings is composed of interest, dividends, and net changes in the fair value 
of applicable investments. 

I. Scholarship Allowances 

A scholarship allowance is the difference between the stated charge for goods and 
services the District provides and the amount that the student or third parties making 
payments on the student’s behalf pays. Accordingly, some types of student financial aid, 
such as Pell grants and scholarships the District awards, are considered scholarship          
allowances. These allowances are netted against tuition and fees revenues in the 
statement of revenues, expenses, and changes in net position.

Notes to Financial Statements 

June 30, 2020 

Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (concluded) 

J. Compensated Absences 

Compensated absences payable consists of compensatory time earned for classified 
employees; vacation pay for benefit eligible administrative, professional, and classified 
employees; and a calculated amount of sick leave by grandfathered employees based on 
services already rendered. 

The balance of compensatory time earned for classified staff is paid, at the employee’s 
current rate of pay, in full at the time of the employee’s termination or if an employee
becomes ineligible for benefits. Accordingly, compensatory time earned is accrued as a 
liability in the financial statements. 

Vacation pay is for the purpose of providing benefit eligible employees the opportunity to 
take time off work without loss of compensation. At June 30 of each year, an employee may 
carry forward two times his/her  maximum accrual for the year, but they forfeit any unused 
vacation in excess of two times the annual accrual rate. Upon terminating employment or if 
an employee becomes ineligible for benefits, the District pays, at his/her rate of pay at the 
time of termination, a lump sum based upon consecutive years of service. At no time can 
the maximum vacation paid exceed one year’s accrual. Accordingly, vacation benefits are 
accrued as a liability in the financial statements. 

Employees hired prior to January 1996 are grandfathered under the sick leave procedure in 
effect at that time. The grandfather clause provides that after 10 years of service, 50% of 
unused accrued sick leave up to a maximum of 1,040 hours be payable at termination; and 
upon normal retirement as defined by the Arizona State Retirement System, 100% of 
unused accrued sick leave up to a maximum of 2,080 hours will be payable at termination. 
The rate to be paid is the hourly rate as of June 30, 2009, and the number of hours paid
shall not exceed the hours on record as of June 30, 2009. Accordingly, grandfathered sick 
leave benefits are accrued as a liability in the financial statements.  

With the passage of Arizona Proposition 206, effective July 1, 2017, sick leave was 
extended to part-time and seasonal employees. The law mandates that for every 30 hours 
worked, an hour of paid sick leave be accrued to a maximum of 40 hours per year. While 
sick leave is tracked for all employees, it is not paid out at time of termination and, 
therefore, is not considered a liability in the financial statements. 

Note 2 - Deposits and Investments 

Arizona Revised Statutes (A.R.S.) requires the District to deposit special tax levies for the 
District’s maintenance or capital outlay with the County Treasurer. A.R.S. does not require 
the District to deposit other public monies in its custody with the County Treasurer; 
however, the District must act as a prudent person dealing with another’s property
when making investment decisions about those monies. A.R.S. requires collateral for 
deposits at 102 percent of all deposits not covered by federal depository insurance. A.R.S. 
does not include any requirements for credit risk, concentration of credit risk, interest rate 
risk, or foreign currency risk for the District’s investments. 

Deposits - At June 30, 2020, the carrying amount of the District’s deposits was $485,598 
and the bank balance was $611,493. The District does not have a formal policy with 
respect to custodial credit risk. 

Investments - The District had the following investments in external investment pools
measured at fair value:

Notes to Financial Statements 

June 30, 2020 

Note 2 - Deposits and Investments (continued) 

Investments in the State Treasurer’s investment pools are valued at the pool’s share price 
multiplied by the number of shares the District held. The fair value of a participant’s position 
in the pools approximates the value of that participant’s pool shares. The investment in the 
County Treasurer’s pool is valued using the District’s proportionate participation in the pool 
because the pool’s structure does not provide for shares. The State Board of Investment 
provides oversight for the State Treasurer’s investment pools. No comparable oversight is 
provided for the County Treasurer’s investment pool.  

Credit risk - The District does not have a formal policy with respect to credit risk. Credit 
risk for the District’s investments at June 30, 2020 was as follows:  

Interest rate risk - The District does not have a formal policy with respect to interest rate 
risk. At June 30, 2020, the District had the following investments in debt securities: 

A reconciliation of cash, deposits, and investments to amounts shown on the Statement of 
Net Position follows:

classes for some assets. The District reclassified $170,687 from Intangibles to Equipment, 
along with $153,619 in accumulated depreciation. The total net capital assets did not 
change.

 Note 5 - Long-Term Liabilities 

The following schedule details the District’s long-term liability and obligation activity for the 
year ended June 30, 2020: 

Note 6 - Risk Management 

The District is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts; theft of, damage to, and 
destruction of assets; errors and omissions; injuries to employees; and natural disasters. 
The District carries commercial insurance for all such risks of loss, including workers’ 
compensation, property loss, and casualty insurance. Settled claims resulting from these 
risks have not exceeded commercial insurance coverage in any of the past three fiscal 
years. 

The District provides life, accidental death and dismemberment, disability, medical, and 
dental insurance benefits to its employees and their dependents through a pooled trust, the 
Northern Arizona Public Employees Benefit Trust (NAPEBT), currently composed of the 
City of Flagstaff, Coconino County, Flagstaff Unified School District, Northern Arizona 
Intergovernmental Public Transit Authority, Coconino County Accommodation School, and 
the District. The NAPEBT is self-funded through an agreement with the participating
members and NAPEBT administers the plan. The members’ employee and employer 
contributions are paid to pay benefits and administrative expenses. If the District withdraws 
from the NAPEBT, it is responsible for its proportionate share of any claims’ run-out costs, 
including claims reported but not settled, claims incurred but not reported, and 
administrative costs. If the NAPEBT were to terminate, the District would be responsible for 
its proportional share of any trust deficit. 

Note 7 - Operating Leases 

The District leases the land on which the Fourth Street campus resides. The lease 
agreement is classified as an operating lease for accounting purposes. Rental expenses 
under the terms of the operating lease were $50,809 for the year ended June 30, 2020. 

The operating lease has a remaining non-cancelable term of 4 years and allows four       
renewal options for eleven years each. Rental payments may be adjusted every five years 
based on changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The following future minimum 
payments were required under the operating lease at June 30, 2020:

Note 8 - Pension Benefits 

Plan description - District employees participate in the Arizona State Retirement System 
(ASRS). The ASRS administers a cost-sharing multiple-employer defined benefit pension 
plan. The Arizona State Retirement System Board governs the ASRS according to the 
provisions of A.R.S. Title 38, Chapter 5, Article 2. The ASRS is a component unit of the 
State of Arizona. The ASRS issues a publicly available financial report that includes its 
financial statements and required supplementary information. The report is available on its 
website at www.azasrs.gov. 

Benefits provided - The ASRS provides retirement and survivor benefits. State statute 
establishes benefit terms. Retirement benefits are calculated on the basis of age, average 
monthly compensation, and service credit as follows: 

Retirement benefits for members who joined the ASRS prior to September 13, 2013, are 
subject to automatic cost-of-living adjustments based on excess investment earning.
Members with a membership date on or after September 13, 2013, are not eligible for 
cost-of-living adjustments. Survivor benefits are payable upon a member’s death. For 
retired members, the retirement benefit option chosen determines the survivor benefit. For

all other members, the beneficiary is entitled to the member’s account balance that includes 
the member’s contributions and the employer’s contributions, plus interest earned. 

Contributions - In accordance with state statutes, annual actuarial valuations determine 
active member and employer contribution requirements. The combined active member and 
employer contribution rates are expected to finance the costs of the benefits employees 
earn during the year, with an additional amount to finance any unfunded accrued liability.  
For the year ended June 30, 2020, statute required active ASRS members to contribute at 
the actuarially determined rate of 11.94 percent for retirement of the members’ annual 
covered payroll, and statute required the District to contribute at the actuarially determined 
rate of 11.45 percent for retirement of the active members’ annual covered payroll. In 
addition, the District was required by statute to contribute at the actuarially determined rate 
of 10.29 percent for retirement of annual covered payroll of retired members who worked 
for the District in positions that an employee who contributes to the ASRS would typically 
fill. The District’s contributions to the pension plan for the year ended June 30, 2020, were 
$1,112,584. 

Pension liability - At June 30, 2020, the District reported a liability of $12,889,421 for its 
proportionate share of the ASRS’ net pension liability.   

The net pension liability was measured as of June 30, 2019.  The total pension liability used 
to calculate the net pension liability was determined using updated procedures to roll 
forward the total pension liability from an actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2018, to the 
measurement date of June 30, 2019. 

The District’s proportion of the net pension liability was based on the District’s actual 
contributions to the plan relative to the total of all participating employer’s contributions for 
the year ended June 30, 2019. The District’s proportion measured as of June 30, 2019, 
was 0.08858%, down 0.0013 from its proportion measured as of June 30, 2018. 

Pension expense and deferred outflows/inflows of resources - For the year ended 
June 30, 2020, the District recognized the pension expense of $2,112,341. 

At June 30, 2020, the District reported deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows 
of resources related to pensions from the following sources:

 Note 8 - Pension Benefits (continued) 

The $1,112,584 reported as deferred outflows of resources related to the ASRS pension
resulting from District contributions subsequent to the measurement date will be recognized 
as a reduction of the net pension liability in the year ending June 30, 2021. Other amounts 
reported as deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources related to the 
ASRS pension will be recognized as expenses as follows:  

Actuarial assumptions - The significant actuarial assumptions used to measure the total 
pension liability are as follows: 

Actuarial assumptions used in the June 30, 2018 valuation were based on the results of an 
actuarial experience study for the 5-year period ended June 30, 2016. 

The long-term expected rate of return on ASRS pension plan investments was determined 
to be 7.5 percent using a building-block method in which best-estimate ranges of expected 
future real rates of return (expected returns, net of pension plan investment expense and 
inflation) are developed for each major asset class. These ranges are combined to 
produce the long-term expected rate of return by weighting the expected future real rates of 
return by the target asset allocation percentage; and by adding the expected inflation. The 
target allocation and best estimates of geometric real rates of return for each major asset 
class are summarized in the following table:

Note 8 - Pension Benefits (concluded) 

Discount rate - The discount rate used to measure the ASRS total pension liability was 7.5 
percent. The projection of cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed that 
contributions from participating employers will be made based on the actuarially 
determined rates based on the ASRS Board’s funding policy, which establishes the 
contractually required rate under Arizona statute. Based on those assumptions, the 
pension plan’s fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all projected 
future benefit payments of current plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate 
of return on pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit 
payments to determine the total pension liability. 

Sensitivity of the District’s proportionate share of the ASRS net pension liability to 
changes in the discount rate - The following table presents the District’s proportionate 
share of the net pension liability calculated using the discount rate of 7.5 percent, as well 
as what the District’s proportionate share of the net pension liability would be if it were 
calculated using a discount rate that is 1 percentage point lower (6.5 percent) or 1 
percentage point higher (8.5 percent) than the current rate: 

Pension plan fiduciary net position - Detailed information about the pension plan’s 
fiduciary net position is available in the separately issued ASRS financial report. 

Pension plan contributions payable - The District’s accrued payroll and employee
benefits included $76,773 of outstanding pension contribution amounts payable to ASRS 
for the year ended June 30, 2020. 

Note 9 - Other Postemployment Benefits (OPEB) 

The District follows Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 75, 
Accounting and Financial Reporting by Employers for Postemployment Benefits Other 
Than Pensions, for certain postemployment health care benefits provided by the Northern 
Arizona Public Employee Benefit Trust (NAPEBT) and ASRS. Although an ASRS OPEB 
liability has been recorded at June 30, 2020, its plans have not been further disclosed due 
to the relative insignificance to the District’s financial statements.

Note 9 - Other Postemployment Benefits (OPEB) (continued) 

postemployment health care benefits. The District subsidizes the premium rates paid by 
retirees by allowing them to participate in the District’s health care plan at reduced or 
blended group (implicitly subsidized) premium rates for both active and retired employees. 
These rates provide an implicit rate subsidy for retirees because, on an actuarial basis, 
their current and future claims are expected to result in higher costs to the plan on average 
than those of active employees. 

The District does not cover any explicit subsidies. 

Employees may be retained on the District’s health insurance provided they make the 
required contributions and comply with all other provisions of the plan. To be eligible, an 
employee must retire from the District with five years of service as a benefit eligible 
employee and apply for and receive retirement. Retirees can maintain their coverage under 
the provisions of this program until the retiree reaches age 65, which is when he/she
qualifies for Medicare. Dependent coverage is available subject to the limitations outlined in 
the District’s health insurance policy. Dependents cannot continue in the insurance 
program when the retiree is no longer eligible. 

If a covered retiree terminates coverage for any reason, coverage cannot be reinstated. 
And while the District does not issue a stand-alone, publicly available financial report for 
the plan, the NAPEBT trustees do issue annual audited financial statements covering all its 
constituents’ plans. 

At July 1, 2019, plan membership consisted of the following: 

Funding policy – Benefit provisions for the District’s OPEB plan under NAPEBT are 
pursuant to the District’s policy and can be amended by the District Governing Board. The 
current funding policy is pay-as-you-go for OPEB benefits. There are no dedicated assets 
at this time to offset the OPEB liability. 

OPEB liability - At June 30, 2020, the District reported a total OPEB liability of $943,229 of 
which $909,963 relates to the NAPEBT plan. The plan’s total OPEB liability was measured 
as of June 30, 2019, and was determined by an actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2019. 
The total OPEB liability as of June 30, 2019, reflects the following changes of actuarial 
assumptions and benefit terms for the NAPEBT plan: 

 Higher than expected per capita health costs and demographic changes resulting in an 
actuarial experience loss  

 Updated trend on per capita health costs; reflection of 2020/2021 actual premiums 

 Valuation assumption changes due to the lowering of the discount rate 

The following table shows changes in the District’s OPEB liability, the District’s annual 
OPEB cost for the year, and the amount actually contributed to the NAPEBT plan:

and participating members, and include the types of benefits provided at the time of each 
valuation and the historical pattern of sharing of benefit costs between the employer and 
participating members. The actuarial methods and assumptions used include techniques
that are designed to reduce the effects of short-term volatility in actuarial accrued liabilities 
and actuarial value of assets, consistent with the long-term perspective of the calculations. 

The District’s actuarial methods and significant assumptions for the NAPEBT single-
employer postemployment plan for the most recent actuarial valuation are as follows: 

Benefit projections assume the specified premium amount will follow the current practice of 
being paid for entirely by the retiree or on behalf of the retiree. The specified premium 
amounts are projected to increase at the contribution trend rates noted above. Actuarial 
assumptions used in the June 30, 2019, valuation were based on the results of an actuarial 
experience study for the 5-year period ended June 30, 2016, and effective as of June 30, 
2017. 

Discount rate – The discount rate for OPEB funded entirely on a pay-as-you-go basis is 
the yield or index rate for 20-year, tax exempt general obligation municipal bonds with an 
average rate of AA/Aa or higher (or equivalent quality on another rating scale). For this 
purpose, the Bond Buyer 20-Bond General Obligation Municipal Bond Index was used.   

Sensitivity analysis - The following shows the net impact of the OPEB liability calculated 
using the discount rate of 3.50%, as well as what the District’s liability would be if the 
discount rate is 1% less than and 1% greater than the current rate:  

The following table presents the OPEB liability calculated using the healthcare cost trend

The District’s operating expenses are presented by functional classification in the 
statement of revenues, expenses, and changes in net position – primary government. The 
operating expenses can also be classified into the following: 

Note 11 - Financial Impact of COVID-19 

The closure of the District’s campuses and the switch to a virtual environment in March of 
2020 had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on the District’s finances. There were 
immediate unexpected expenses, like software that would allow more access to online 
teaching, additional technology support costs, supplies for creating social distancing and 
keeping up with CDC guidelines for sanitation during a pandemic, increased janitorial 
expenses, and others. Revenues have declined as well as there are no opportunities to rent 
facilities, sell in the bookstore, vending, or other items. The impact on enrollment is ongoing. 
Students experienced disruptions from COVID-19; unemployment rose and prices for basic 
goods and services increased. Fortunately, as part of the CARES Act, Higher Education 
Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF) monies were disbursed to more than 5,000 educational 
institutions nationwide, including Coconino Community College. 

The District was allocated two portions, of $551,835 each, from the HEERF apportionment. 
The first portion was designated as entirely for students, as emergency student aid. These 
funds were disbursed in two distributions, one in spring 2020 and one in the summer. Once 
disbursed, the District was reimbursed by HEERF. The distributions are included with 
scholarships under operating expenses and the reimbursement is part of government grants. 

The second portion will be reimbursed to the District as spent. As of June 30, 2020, $86,932 
had been accrued as reimbursable to the District from this second portion, the institutional 
funds. $54,234 of this total represents expenses included within operating expenses. Tuition 
refunds, made in the spring to students who could not continue their coursework online, 
totaled $32,698. This is considered foregone revenue and is reimbursable. The District has 
one year from the granting of the HEERF award to use the remaining funds.

Note 12 - Subsequent Event 

On October 29, 2020, a stipulated judgment was reached in Transwestern Pipeline Company LLC 
vs the Arizona Department of Revenue. According to the judgment, properties taxed to the 
Transwestern Pipeline Company LLC since 2015 are to be re-assessed with a significantly re-
duced valuation. The District’s portion of the estimated property tax refund to Transwestern Pipe-
line Company LLC as of June 30,2020, is $219,248. Since this amount was determined by the 
courts and not through a settlement, the District can defray payment for one year and levy these 
taxes in the following year. In FY2021, the refund is expected to increase by an additional 
$45,279. 

Note 13 - Discretely Presented Component Unit Disclosures 

1. Nature of Organization 

The Coconino Community College Foundation (Foundation) was founded in 1993 under Arizona 
law as a nonprofit organization. The mission of the Foundation is to promote the purposes and 
goals of Coconino Community College (College), thereby enhancing the opportunities of Coconino 
residents. It is the fundraising organization for the solicitation, receipt and management of all pri-
vate gifts, donations, and contributions, including gifts-in-kind. Funds are disbursed exclusively for 
charitable and educational purposes within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code Section 
501(c)(3), including providing scholarships and financial aid, to fulfill the teaching and service func-
tions of the College, and to make or receive grants and loans of corporate property for the purpos-
es of the College. The Foundation’s primary source of revenue is from private contributions. An 
operating agreement between the Foundation and the College is reviewed and renewed annually. 

Basis of Accounting 

The Foundation records financial statements using the accrual basis of accounting and accord-
ingly reflect all significant receivables, payables, and other liabilities. 

Basis of Presentation 

The financial statements of the Foundation have been prepared in conformity with accounting 
principles generally accepted in the United States of America as applied to not-for-profit enti-
ties. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is the accepted standard-setting body 
for establishing not-for-profit accounting and financial reporting principles. The Foundation is 
required to report information regarding its financial position and activities according to two 
classes based on the existence or absence of donor-imposed restrictions. Accordingly, net as-
sets of the Foundation and changes therein are classified as follows: 

Net assets without donor restrictions – Net assets that are not subject to donor-imposed stip-
ulations. The Board, through its investment policy, has designated net assets to safeguard
against investment variability. These designated funds represent accumulated unrealized 
earnings that are not allocated to net assets with donor restrictions. 

Net assets with donor restrictions – Net assets subject to donor-imposed stipulations. Some 
donor restrictions are temporary in nature; those restrictions will be met either by actions of 
the Foundation and/or the passage of time. Other donor restrictions are perpetual in nature, 
where by the donor has stipulated the funds must be maintained in perpetuity.

Notes to Financial Statements 

June 30, 2020 

Note 13 - Discretely Presented Component Unit Disclosures (continued) 

Donor-restricted contributions are reported as an increase in net assets with donor restrictions. 
When a restriction expires (that is, when a stipulated time restriction ends or purpose 
restriction is accomplished), net assets are reclassified to net assets without donor restrictions 
and reported in the Statement of Activities as net assets released from restrictions. 

Use of Estimates 

In preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America, management is required to make estimates and assumptions. 
Those estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the 
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported revenues and expenses. Actual 
results could differ from those estimates. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

For purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows, the Foundation considers all highly liquid 
investments with an initial maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  

Investments 

The Foundation reports investments at fair value in the Statement of Financial Position. 
Realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in the Statement of Activities.  Donated 
securities are received directly into the Fidelity Investments account at market values as of the 
date executed. On an annual basis, all investment income, which consists of interest and 
dividend income, realized and unrealized capital gains and losses, less investment expense, is
allocated between net assets with donor restrictions and net assets without donor restrictions 
in accordance with the Foundation’s policy. 

Concentrations of Credit and Market Risk 

Financial instruments that potentially expose the Foundation to concentrations of credit and 
market risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and investments. The Foundation maintains 
its cash and cash equivalents in bank deposit accounts, which, for short periods of time, may 
exceed federally insured limits. At year end, the carrying amount of the Foundation’s deposits 
was $296,988 and the bank balance was $296,586. At year end, none of the Foundation’s 
deposits were uninsured and uncollateralized. To minimize risk, cash accounts are maintained 
at high-quality financial institutions and credit exposure is limited to any one institution. The 
Foundation’s investments do not represent significant concentrations of market risk inasmuch 
as the Foundation’s investment portfolio is adequately diversified among issuers. Additionally, 
funds deposited with Fidelity Investments and Edward Jones are protected by the Securities 
Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) up to a ceiling of $500,000 including a maximum of 
$250,000 for cash claims.  

Contributions Receivable 

Unconditional promises to give are recognized as revenues when the promise is received. 
Conditional promises to give are recognized only when the conditions on which they depend 
are substantially met and the promises become unconditional. 

Unconditional promises to give that are expected to be collected in less than one year are 
reported at net realizable value. Unconditional promises to give  that are expected  to be  
collected in periods greater than one year are recorded at net present value of expected cash 
flows. Management does not believe an allowance for uncollectible amounts is necessary  
based on historical experience with this donor, and accordingly has made no allowance for 
doubtful accounts.

Donations of property and equipment are recorded as contributions at fair value at the date of

unless the donor has restricted the donated asset to a specific purpose. Assets donated with 
explicit restrictions regarding their use and contributions of cash that must be used to acquire 
property and equipment are reported as increases in net assets with donor restrictions. 
Absent donor stipulations regarding how long those donated assets must be maintained, the 
Foundation reports expirations of donor restrictions when the donated or acquired assets are 
placed in service. The Foundation reclassifies net assets with donor restrictions to net assets 
without restrictions at that time. 

Volunteers contribute significant amounts of time to the Foundation’s program services, 
administration, and fundraising activities; however the financial statements do not reflect the 
value of these contributed services because they do not meet recognition criteria prescribed 
in generally accepted accounting principles. 

Functional Allocation of Expenses 

The costs of providing various programs and other activities have been summarized on a 
functional basis in the Statement of Activities and in the Statement of Functional Expenses. 
Accordingly, certain costs have been allocated among the programs and supporting services 
benefited. Such allocations are determined by management on an equitable basis. 

The expenses that are allocated include the following: 

Expense Method of Allocation 

Salaries and benefits Primary function 

All other expenses Full time equivalent 

Income Tax Status 

The Foundation is exempt from federal income tax under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal 
Revenue Code and similar State of Arizona tax provisions. In addition, the Foundation 
qualifies for the charitable contribution deduction under Section 170(b)(1)(A) and has been 
classified as an organization other than a private foundation under Section 509(a)(2). The 
Foundation’s Form 990, Return of Organization Exempt from Income Taxes is generally 
subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for three years after the date filed. 

New Accounting Pronouncement 

During the fiscal year, the Foundation adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 
2018-08, Clarifying the Scope of the Accounting Guidance for Contributions Received and 
Contributions Made (Topic 958). The update provides clarifying guidance on accounting for 
the grants and contracts of nonprofit organizations as they relate to the new revenue standard 
(ASU 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers), and aims  to minimize  diversity  in

the classification of grants and contracts that exists under current guidance. The Foundation 
has adjusted the presentation of these statements accordingly. 

Date of Management’s Review 

In preparing these financial statements, the Foundation has evaluated events and 
transactions for potential recognition or disclosure through September 30, 2020, which is the 
date the financial statements were available to be issued. 

2. Cash and Cash Equivalents 

The following were included in cash and cash equivalents as of June 30: 

3. Liquidity and Availability 

The following represents the Foundation’s financial assets at fiscal year end: 

The Board requires that at least 5% of investments be available in cash equivalents. 
Additionally, it is general practice that all significant endowment gifts are sent to the  
investment account as soon as practical. 

The Board designated net assets represent accumulated unallocated unrealized gains on 
investments and are being accounted for separately as per the Foundation’s investment 
policy. The funds represent a cushion against down turning investment markets.

4. Investments and Fair Value Measurements 

Fair value is defined as the price that the Foundation would receive to sell an asset or pay to 
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement 
date. 

Accounting standards establish a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to 
valuation techniques. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants use to 
make valuation decisions, including assumptions about risk. Observable inputs are those that 
reflect the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset and are based 
on market data obtained from independent sources. Unobservable inputs reflect the 
Foundation’s assumptions about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset 
or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.  The three-
tier hierarchy of inputs is summarized in the three broad levels listed below: 

Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical investments. 

Level 2: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted 
prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, 
inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or 
liability. 

Level 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. 

The level of fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is
based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. 

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value for each 
class of financial instrument measured in fair value. 

Investments – Fair values for investments are determined by reference to quoted market 
prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions. 

The Foundation recognizes transfers into and out of levels within the fair value hierarchy at 
the end of the reporting period. There were no transfers between levels during the current 
fiscal year.

Unconditional contributions receivable consist of the following:

6. Endowments 

The Foundation’s endowment consists of approximately 25 individual funds established for a 
variety of purposes. Its endowment includes donor-restricted funds. As required by generally 
accepted accounting principles (GAAP), net assets associated with endowment funds are 
classified and reported based on the existence or absence of donor-imposed restrictions. 

Interpretation of Relevant Law 

The Board of Directors of the Foundation has interpreted the State of Arizona’s version of the 
Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act (UPMIFA) as requiring the 
preservation of the fair value of the original gift as of the gift date of the donor-restricted 
endowment funds absent explicit donor stipulations to the contrary. As a result of this 
interpretation, the Foundation retains in perpetuity (a) the original value of initial and 
subsequent gifts donated to the endowment and (b) any accumulations to the endowment 
made in accordance with the direction of the applicable donor gift instrument at the time the 
accumulation is added. Donor-restricted amounts not retained in perpetuity are subject to 
appropriation for expenditures by the Foundation in a manner consistent with the standard of 
prudence prescribed by UPMIFA. 

In accordance with UPMIFA, the Foundation considers the following factors in making a 
determination to appropriate or accumulate donor-restricted endowment funds: 

a. The duration and preservation of the fund 

b. The purpose of the donor-restricted endowment fund 

c. General economic conditions 

d. The possible effect of inflation and deflation 

e. The expected total return from income and the appreciation of investments 

f. Other resources of the Foundation 

g. The investment policies of the Foundation

Endowment Net Asset Composition by Type of Fund as of year end: 

Investment Return Objectives, Risk Parameters and Strategies 

The Foundation has adopted investment and spending policies, approved by the Board, for 
endowment assets that attempt to provide a predictable stream of funding to programs 
supported by its endowment funds while also maintaining the purchasing power of those 
endowment assets over the long-term. Accordingly, the investment process seeks to achieve 
an after-cost total real rate of return, including investment income as well as capital 
appreciation, which exceeds the annual distribution with acceptable levels of risk. 
Endowment assets are invested in a well-diversified asset mix, which includes equity and debt
securities, that is intended to result in a consistent inflation-protected rate of return that has 
sufficient liquidity to make an annual distribution of four percent, while growing the funds if 
possible. Actual returns in any given year may vary from this amount. Investment risk is 
measured in terms of the total endowment fund; investment assets and allocation between 
asset classes and strategies are managed to not expose the fund to unacceptable levels of 
risk. 

Spending Policy 

The Foundation has a policy of appropriating for distribution each year four percent of its 
endowment fund’s prior year-end balance. In establishing this policy, the Foundation 
considered the long-term expected return on its investment assets, the nature and duration of 
the individual endowment funds, many of which must be maintained in perpetuity because of 
donor-restrictions, and the possible effects of inflation. The Foundation expects the current 
spending policy to allow its endowment funds to continue to grow. This is consistent with the 
Foundation’s objective to maintain the purchasing power of the endowment assets held in 
perpetuity or for a specified term as well as to provide additional real growth through new gifts 
and investment return. 

The Foundation has a scholarship committee made up of Foundation, community and  
College faculty and staff members which meets approximately six times per year to advise the 
Board of Directors as to how much money to allocate to scholarships. 

Scholarship values vary based on the annual interest earned on the endowment. At the 
Foundation’s discretion, an award or awards may be granted for an entire academic year or 
for a period of less than one full academic year.  If the earnings and income of a scholarship

are not sufficient to fund one full award, then the Foundation may, in its discretion, grant an 
award equal to the amount of such earnings and income or determine not to make any award for 
the year, in which case, the amount of such earnings and income shall be carried forward to the 
next academic year.

8. Donated Services 

The fair value of donated services included as contributions in the financial statements and 
the corresponding program expenses for the current year ended is as follows: 

9. Concentrations 

The Foundation has consistently retained long-term donors, one of which gives in excess of 
$100,000 annually, representing more than 12 percent of revenues in a typical year. Loss of 
such a donor in the near-term could cause a significant reduction in the Foundation’s ability to 
disburse grants and awards. 

In the prior fiscal year, the Foundation received a nearly $1 million grant from the Del E. Webb 
Foundation. The grant, payable over three years, is for the College’s Construction and 
Technology programs and will go towards updating the teaching facilities and expanding 
program offerings. 

10. Contingent Liability 

For the year ended June 30, 2020, the Foundation had scholarships that have been awarded 
but not paid in the amount of $117,885. These scholarships are awarded in two payments, 
with the first payment given upon enrollment for the fall semester; the second payment is 
made conditionally upon enrollment for the spring semester. As the scholarships are 
contingent upon enrollment and paid out over the following fiscal year, they are not recorded 
as a liability as of June 30, 2020.  

11. Related Party Transactions 

Coconino Community College contributes to the Foundation certain supporting services per a 
written agreement. Employees of the College perform the Foundation administrative and 
accounting duties. The amounts included in public contributions without donor restrictions for 
these services were $214,125. An additional $11,145 was contributed for facilities related 
expenses. In the opinion of management, such transactions were on substantially the same 
terms as those that would prevail with other unrelated persons and entities. 

12. Prior Period Reclassification 

The July 1, 2019 beginning net assets do agree to the prior year financial statements. 
However, there was a reclassification of $18,075 from net assets with donor restrictions to net 
assets without donor restrictions to conform to a reclassification error between unrealized and 
realized gains.  There was no impact on total assets or changes in total net assets reported. 

13. Risk Management and COVID-19 

During March of 2020, most of the nation went into lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Numerous activities and events had to be canceled or postponed including the Foundation’s 
annual Palate to Palette fundraiser as well as other group meetings. The College also went 
into lockdown and all classes shifted to a virtual format. Students were given the option to

have their tuition refunded and some did take advantage of this. Additionally, some scholar-
ships were given back as well. The College has experienced enrollment declines as a result of 
the pandemic as students are opting out of online learning. The long-term impacts are unknown
and the College has developed additional contingency plans accordingly. Likewise, the future of 
the Foundation’s fundraising and social events is also uncertain. Scholarships are being given 
out but there is a risk that students may decide to not attend.

 Note 1 - Factors That Affect Trends 

There was a financial austerity plan in place from FY2009 through FY2012. During this 
time wages were frozen and no increases were funded. For FY2013 there were larger than 
normal salary increases to bring long-term employees up to market with new employees
that were placed in at higher rates during the wage freeze. 

In FY2016 the College experienced significant turnover in executive leadership positions 
from retirements and resignations that resulted in higher than typical vacancy savings. The 
covered payroll for FY2017 increased compared to FY2016 as a result of having more 
positions filled. The College’s concerted effort to hire more full time faculty resulted in a 
continued increase in covered payroll for FY2018 and again in FY2019 as additional 
vacancies were filled.
