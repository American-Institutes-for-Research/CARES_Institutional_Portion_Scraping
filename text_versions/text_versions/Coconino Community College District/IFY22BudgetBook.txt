Background information  
The College has served residents across 18,000 square miles of Coconino County since 1991 and has helped 
create the region’s skilled workforce, which is improving overall health, safety, and the economy in the region.   

History 
In November 1990, the citizens of Coconino County established the College under the provisions of legislation 
enacted by the Arizona State Legislature in 1971. In May 1991, the College’s funding was approved through a 
special election and operations began on July 1, 1991. The College boundaries are conterminous to the 
boundaries of Coconino County.  
 
When the District began in 1991, the College was initially expected to serve 600 students per year. Nearly 
1,000 students registered the first semester and continued to increase dramatically. Today the College enrolls 
4,948 annually (unduplicated headcount). 
 
Geography and Population 
Coconino County is located in north-central Arizona and encompasses an area of approximately 12 million 
acres. Its boundaries include the cities of Page, Fredonia, Grand Canyon, Williams, Sedona, and Flagstaff, as 
well as other smaller cities and towns and all the unincorporated areas of the County. Coconino County’s 2021 
estimated population is 145,382 with a growth rate of 0.66% in the past year according to the most recent 
United States census data. Coconino County is the 8th largest county in Arizona. The 2010 population 
was 134,612 and has seen a growth of 8.00% since that time.  
 
With 18,661 square miles, Coconino County is the second-largest county in the United States and the largest in 
Arizona but is one of the most sparsely populated. It is characterized by rugged mountains, deep canyons and 
thick forests of pine, spruce, aspen, and oak. Within its borders are many scenic sites – the most popular and 
impressive is Grand Canyon National Park. Other attractions are Oak Creek Canyon, Sunset Crater National 
Monument, prehistoric Indian ruins at Wupatki, Walnut Canyon, the Navajo National Monument, the San 
Francisco Peaks - Arizona’s highest point at 12,633 feet - and Lake Powell with 1,960 miles of shoreline. 
 
Tribal Lands comprise 39.1 percent of the County and are home to the Navajo, Hopi, Paiute, Havasupai, and 
Hualapai tribes. The U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management control 32.3 percent of the land, the 
State of Arizona owns 9.4 percent, the National Park Service controls 6.9 percent, and the remaining 12.3 
percent is owned by individuals or corporations. 
 
Local Economy 
A large share of the County's labor force is weighted towards government, trade, and service employment. The 
percent employed by the government is 30% which is relatively high compared to the rest of the state. The 
reason for a large number of government workers in Coconino County includes the presence of several major 
national parks, tribal lands, and the high percentage of the total area in County public lands.  The County 
unemployment rate as of June 2021 (8.0%) is above both the state unemployment (6.8%) and above national 
levels (5.9%).  The unemployment rates have begun to decrease since the dramatic rise the prior year due to 
the impact of COVID-19. 
 
Educational Programs 
The College offers affordable tuition rates and a variety of certificates and degrees, including career/technical 
programs, with nearly 50 certificate programs and two-year associate degrees in various fields. Those fields 
include nursing, fire science, law enforcement, construction, and business.  Additionally, CCC has programs 
that ease student transition to all three of Arizona’s state universities. CCC also offers dual enrollment and 
concurrent enrollment programs to jump-start high schools students’ higher education goals.

Educational Programs (continued) 
Additionally, CCC reaches out to the more rural portions of the County including Williams, the Grand 
Canyon/Tusayan, Page/Lake Powell, Fredonia, Tuba City, and other remote areas on the Navajo, Hopi, and 
Supai Tribal Lands. Instructional sites offer classes through online, in-person, and distance learning classes to 
meet the needs of students in these rural and remote areas.  
 
Student Population 
The College serves a diverse population of students each year. Most are Coconino County residents: 20% are 
Native American, 21% are Hispanic, 55% are female, 79% are seeking a degree or certificate, 23% are high 
school students earning college credit through dual enrollment high school programs, and 2.7% are people who 
already have bachelors or advanced academic degrees. 
 
Community Engagement 
CCC is committed to offering additional services to meet the County residents’ needs. These efforts are 
achieved through careful monitoring of costs, innovative partnerships, cost-saving opportunities, and seeking 
new revenue sources. 
 
Facilities 
The College serves the educational needs of Coconino County through three facilities: the Flagstaff Lone Tree 
Campus and District Offices, the Flagstaff Fourth Street Innovation Campus and Technology Center/FMC 
Institute for Nursing Education, and the Page Center. In addition, the College partners with others to provide 
services in Tuba City and Fredonia. District-wide administrative and support services are centralized and 
administered by the President, Executive Vice President, Provost, and the respective Deans. 
 
District Governing Board  
The College is a political subdivision of the State of Arizona and is subject to the oversight of the District’s 
Governing Board (the Board), which is comprised of five elected members representing each of the five 
precincts of the County. These members are elected for six-year terms on a staggered basis. The Board is 
granted full authority from the Arizona Revised Statutes to manage the business and educational needs of the 
District. The administrative staff is responsible for the daily operation of the District.

Introduction to Challenges and Solutions  

 
 
As CCC Administration began planning the FY22 budget, several challenges, opportunities, and solutions 
were identified that were factored into the budget planning cycle. A significant part of this process involved 
addressing the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Other challenges the College has faced and will continue to 
face are addressed throughout this section in more detail, along with the solutions that are being implemented 
to address those challenges.  
 
This challenges and solutions section of the budget has been divided into two sections, Board Priorities, and 
Strategic Planning. While there is an overlap in the themes between the Board Priorities and Strategic 
Planning, they have been subdivided to add clarity and focus. This first section will address the Board 
Priorities.  
 
2020-2021 Board Priorities 
The Board holds an all-day planning retreat in June of each year to develop priorities for the College as well as 
goals for the President and Administration for the upcoming fiscal year. The Board Priorities provide direction 
for the upcoming budget development cycle and resource allocation decisions for the following fiscal year. 
The 2020-2021 Board Priorities listed on the following page were used during the development of the  FY22 
Budget. This section will address the challenges and solutions related to the Board Priorities as follows:     
 
 
Long Term Financial Stability 
Financial Sustainability has been a long–term challenge for the College because of the low property tax rate 
and low state funding. This section reviews the revenue sources in detail, extensive efficiency efforts, as well 
as new initiatives to generate additional resources for the College.  
 
Responsiveness to Student and Community Needs 
This section reviews outreach efforts and community feedback related to perceptions and the requests for new 
academic programs. Meeting the needs for new academic programs will require educational planning, 
prioritization, and funding.    
 
COVID-19 Pandemic 
The pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on the College community. This section reviews many of the 
significant challenges the College has faced as well as mitigation efforts and Federal Emergency Relief 
Funding.  
 
Equity Framework 
This section reviews the College’s efforts to align the demographic diversity of the employees to be more 
reflective of the students, as well as efforts to increase diversity and inclusion awareness for students and 
employees.

2020-2021 Board Priorities for CCC 

 
The Coconino Community College District Governing Board acknowledges the unprecedented challenges 
currently being faced by the College, the community at large, the State of Arizona, and the nation.  The 
COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc around the world and forced Coconino Community College to make 
a series of difficult decisions in order to be able to continue serving students.  

The severe downturn of the economy exacerbated long-standing inequalities in our society, and many 
individuals and local families have been left without economic security.  At the same time, a series of tragic 
events around the country shined a light on the injustice and inequalities that people of color often face on a 
daily basis.  The governing board is committed to ensuring that CCC plays a key role in promoting unity 
within the community and in promoting the wellbeing of our students, faculty, staff, and administration.  

The Board and the President must decide how to allocate the College’s limited financial resources while 
attempting to weigh longer-term ramifications. These circumstances require courage, humility, and resiliency 
to determine the goals and priorities for the 2020 – 2021 academic year.

Challenges and Solutions

The College’s main ongoing challenge is financial. There are three primary sources of revenue, property taxes, 
state aid, and tuition and fees. In 1991, the College was established with a very low primary property tax rate 
for general operational and maintenance expenses. Of the ten community college districts in the state, CCC’s 
property tax rate is substantially lower than any other district as shown in the FY22 Primary Tax Rate chart 
below.  

The state has an equalization formula that was established in the 1970s to help rural districts from smaller  
geographic areas. The equalization formula is based on a minimum assessed value determined by statute and 
indexed annually by the growth in the assessed values of all the rural districts. Districts with levies below the 
minimum assessed value level receive equalization funding for the difference at the assigned tax rate of $1.37. 
The formula does not take into consideration the levy per Full-Time Student Enrollment (FTSE). The     
equalization formula only provides funding to small geographic districts based on the growth in other districts, 
even though the small districts may not have additional students to serve. The FY21 Levy and Equalization 
Aid per FTSE chart show the levy and equalization aid per FTSE. Navajo County qualifies for substantial 
State Equalization Aid even though it receives a much higher levy per student than Coconino.  Coconino has a 
low levy per FTSE and does not qualify for State Equalization Aid because of its large geographic area.   

Challenge - Long-Term Financial Stability 

 



Challenges and Solutions

The state of Arizona has compounded this financial challenge by reducing state appropriations to community 
colleges steadily since 1998 when it provided nearly 45% of the College’s budget. In FY08 the state made        
significant cuts because of the “great recession” and now provides an average of 9% of the College’s General 
Fund budget. For FY21, the College received approximately the same funding per student as it did in 1993 (in 
real dollars) and served 700 more full-time students than in 1993. The Operating State Aid chart shows flat 
funding until FY20 and FY22 when the rural colleges received “one-time funding” allocations which are 
reflected in the two spikes on these charts. One-time funding is not ongoing funding. State Appropriations in 
the long-term are uncertain as the state completely defunded Maintenance and Operations funding for 
Maricopa and Pima Community Colleges, the two largest community colleges in the state.  

Challenge - Long-Term Financial Stability (continued) 



Challenges and Solutions 

12 

 

CCC has been able to adapt and maintain financial strength through long-term financial planning.  As 
discussed on the previous page, the state made significant aid cuts starting in FY08 because of the “great 
recession.” In response to these cuts, the College developed and implemented a Sustainable Financial Plan 
(SFP). The goal of this plan was to ensure long-term financial sustainability while trying to minimize the 
impact on students. The SFP included hundreds of initiatives organized by account type and divided by three 
levels of severity: Efficiency Measures, Critical, and Crisis. By implementing the SFP, the College improved 
its financial position through new revenue generation, expense reductions, and cost avoidance measures. These 
initiatives resulted in savings of $3 million over three years, including the reduction of 25 full-time equivalent 
(FTE) positions.  

 
In 2013 after a second failed override attempt, the College determined it needed to implement more cuts for 
long-term financial sustainability. This phase was called the Financial Austerity Plan (FAP) and invited input 
from the employees to review the SFP with fresh eyes. The employees submitted new recommendations for 
long-term financial solutions. These additional cuts had to come from reductions in programs and services 
because most efficiency initiatives had already been implemented. These initiatives resulted in savings of $1.3 
million over three years ending in FY17.  
 
The lasting result of both of the cost-cutting cycles discussed above is that the College is very efficient.  This is 
demonstrated in the FY21 Expenses per FTSE Comparison (Rural Districts) chart, which shows CCC’s cost 
per FTSE is very low for both the general fund and all funds compared to the other rural districts in the state.  
 

Solution - Financial Planning and New Revenue Streams 

Note: Colleges shown in gold receive equalization funding 



Challenges and Solutions

Solution - Financial Planning and New Revenue Streams (continued) 

In assessing the long-term financial sustainability of the College, extensive cost-cutting has already taken 
place and any further reductions would cut the limited programs the College currently offers. The College is 
looking for new and enhanced revenue sources to fund student and community needs for new programs.  The 
College is seeking additional state aid, large federal grants, and researching property tax options. 
State Appropriations 
The State’s economy has been strong and the community college Presidents have been able to successfully 
secure additional one-time funding for STEM and Workforce programs. One-time funding for start-up costs 
of new programs is helpful; however, ongoing funding is still needed to sustain costly career and technical 
programs as well as much-needed student support services.     
Grants 
The College prioritized and reallocated funding in the FY22 budget for a full-time Grants Coordinator to 
help the College seek out new grant opportunities. 
Research Tax Initiative 
The College is currently researching and gathering information for the Board to consider a ballot initiative to 
permanently increase the very low primary property tax rate.  

The numerous cost-cutting initiatives adopted through the long-term financial planning have aligned revenues 
and expenses and pushed back the projected structural deficit CCC was facing prior to the implementation of 
the plans. More recently, the long-term plan was adjusted to reflect the enrollment drops experienced during 
the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the Federal stimulus funds as shown in the 10-Year Plan chart below, 
with revenues slightly above expenses from FY23 on.

In the Fall of 2017, President Dr. Colleen Smith began outreach efforts by meeting with over 350 people 
during 14 listening sessions facilitated by Kerry Blume. The purpose of these sessions was to better understand 
the community and determine the most important educational needs of residents. Feedback was solicited on 
community member’s vision of the role of CCC, the most important educational needs for residents of the 
County, and their current experience regarding the classes and services offered by CCC. 
 
These community discussions highlighted unmet educational needs in Coconino County. The top community 
needs discussed included technical skill development, health care professional training, early education 
curriculum, support for the hospitality industry, life-long learning, and employment skill development.  
Coconino County residents would like to see CCC focus on the opportunities for strengthening the K-12/
community college connection and expanding dual enrollment, assisting with English as a second language 
program, increased tutoring, leadership development, and enhanced services for deferred action for childhood 
arrival (DACA) students. The focus on reviving life-long learning offerings was also a key opportunity 
identified. 
 
Many of the community priorities identified as needs were items that had been reduced or eliminated during 
cost-cutting efforts necessary for long-term financial sustainability.  For example, reductions to life-long 
learning and the nursing program, and the discontinuation of the early childhood education program were all 
recent service reductions.   
 
The President has continued to meet regularly with community leaders who have requested additional 
programs including Marine Technology, Automotive Technology, Veterinary Technology, Cybersecurity, and 
Commercial Truck Driving. Sustaining these costly new career and technical programs with the very low 
property taxes and limited state fund will continue to be a significant challenge for the College. 
 

Solution - Educational Planning and One-Time Rural  State Funding  
 

Based on the community feedback, the Academic Affairs leadership team have developed educational plans to 
prioritize new academic programs and identify full-time faculty needs. In FY20, early childhood development 
was added back into the curriculum, and inroads towards expanding the nursing program were also made.   
 
With the much-needed $1 million in one-time rural funding appropriations received in FY20, a three-year plan 
is in place to provide seed money to phase in additional Career and Technical programs. For FY21 the three 
priorities were cybersecurity, veterinary tech, and marine tech certifications.  Because of the uncertainties of 
the pandemic and logistical challenges, only the cybersecurity program was able to launch. Implementation of 
the veterinary tech and marine tech certifications has been delayed.  In FY22 a full-time automotive faculty 
member was added as well as a Workforce Development Coordinator.  
 
At the end of the FY22 legislative session in June, the state provided additional one-time funding of $1.9 
million restricted for STEM and Workforce Development programs. In addition, Prop 207, Smart and Safe 
Arizona is providing new restricted revenues for STEM and Workforce programs. Academic Affairs is 
updating its educational plans and these additional resources will help the College make significant progress in 
meeting the stated educational needs of the community and help to increase enrollments.        

Challenge - Responsiveness to Student and Community Needs 



Challenges and Solutions

Challenge - COVID-19 

The COVID-19 pandemic has been unprecedented and resulted in significant challenges and uncertainties 
worldwide. COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that was first identified during an investigation into an outbreak 
in Wuhan, China. The virus spreads easily from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets pro-
duced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Spread is more likely when people are in close contact 
(within 6 feet) with another person.  
 
In March 2020, much of the nation went into lockdown because of the COVID-19 pandemic, forcing CCC to 
shift quickly to mostly remote teaching and working modalities. Numerous activities and events such as gradu-
ation had to be canceled or shifted virtually as everyone was learning to operate in the “new normal.” Later in 
summer 2020, as warm weather arrived, Arizona became a national hot spot for the virus causing increasing 
concern for the College.  
 
Enrollments nationwide have fallen sharply especially for community colleges that serve more students that 
are first-generation, minority, and from a lower socioeconomic status. In addition to the uncertainty caused by 
the pandemic, the disruption of taking care of children made it impossible for many community colleges stu-
dents to take classes.  CCC was not spared and experienced a 20% enrollment drop during FY21. Because of 
this the Board followed a majority of other community colleges in the state and did not increase the tuition 
rates for FY22. In addition to the enrollment decline, the College has incurred significant expenses to mitigate 
risks including facilities, technology, and the remote delivery of instruction and student support services.  

Solution - Mitigation Strategies and Emergency Federal Stimulus Funds 
Under Dr. Smith’s leadership, the College has prioritized open and transparent communications and listened 
carefully to the concerns of our students, faculty, and staff. The President holds regular town hall-styled meet-
ings on Zoom, created a robust website, and has sent out regular updates and communications to keep people 
informed.     

CCC followed the Center for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines as well as recommendations from the Co-
conino County Health Department for a phased approach to reopening the College buildings including: 

Students - Primarily remote learning modalities during the FY21 with limited in-person classes that specifical-
ly require hands-on learning. Waivers are required for in-person students. For Fall 2021 the College plans to 
offer 50% in-person, 25% hybrid, and 25% fully online learning options for students. 

Faculty and Staff – Worked remotely whenever possible providing limited in-person services to members of 
the public that do not have access to technology. All employees are returning to work onsite starting July 2021 
and faculty in August 2021.  

Safety Precautions – Individuals on campus are expected to wear a face covering, practice physical distanc-
ing, wash hands frequently, cough or sneeze into elbows, monitor their health, and stay home if they are sick. 

Facilities – Numerous precautions have been put into place for the safety of students and employees including 
additional cleaning and sanitizing, touchless technologies, hand sanitizer, plexiglass barriers, stanchions, de-
cals, posters, spacing out furniture, and discontinuation of external events. A majority of capital projects 
planned for FY21 and FY22 have been postponed. 

Information Technology – Providing remote working and learning technical assistance, free loaner laptops to 
students, free Wi-Fi in parking lots, and enhanced Zoom technology on campus and remote.

The College has received three rounds of federal stimulus funds called the Coronavirus Aid Relief and Eco-
nomic Security (CARES) of 2020, the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations 
(CRRSA) Act of 2021, and the American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act 2021. These funds are commonly referred 
to as Higher Education Emergency Relief Funds (HEERF) and are targeted towards supporting students and 
institutions of higher learning during the time of the pandemic.  Each round of funding segregates the student 
emergency aid portion (Part A) and institutional aid portion for needs related to the global pandemic (Part B), 
as follows: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Each grant has slightly different requirements and eligibilities, several of which changed over the course of 
the last year. The HEERF-student share dollars are to aid students for expenses related to the disruption of 
campus operations due to the coronavirus; they are not need-based grants but the needier students have prior-
ity in the disbursement of these funds.  Likewise, the institutional portions are reimbursements for expenses 
related to dealing with and mitigating the virus, as well as managing new methods of instructional delivery 
and student support services.  The CRRSAA grant now allows institutions to seek reimbursement for losses 
related to reduced enrollment during the virus.  While ARP added some required uses of the institutional por-
tion grant funds, specifically, a portion of funds must be used to (a) implement evidence-based practices to 
monitor and suppress coronavirus in accordance with public health guidelines; and (b) conduct direct out-
reach to financial aid applicants about the opportunity to apply for financial aid adjustments due to the recent 
unemployment of a family member or student, or other circumstances.  
 
As mentioned above, the federal stimulus packages are helping the College to offset losses from lower en-
rollments and other revenue streams. Lost tuition dollars are significant and estimated to be nearly 
$1,050,000 to date.  Other lost revenues include bookstore revenues, parking permits, state appropriations, 
and facility rental fees.

Students have expressed a desire to have more access to faculty and staff members that look like themselves. 
The demographics from the Fall 20 semester show that 20% of the students are Native American and 21% are 
Hispanic. While the ethnicity of CCC’s students is representative of the county, the College has not been able 
to achieve proportional demographics for faculty and staff members. Data from Spring 2021 states that 7.5% 
of all employees are Native American and 9.2% are Hispanic.  
Additionally, there has been broad interest from students, faculty, staff, and Board members to increase diver-
sity and inclusion awareness for students and employees. In 2018 the College formed a Diversity Committee 
and developed a Diversity Plan, sponsored by the Human Resources (HR) department. The College has priori-
tized implementation of the Diversity Plan and working with the Diversity Committee to identify solutions to 
better serve staff and students.   

 
Solution - Advance Diversity, Equity, and Inclusiveness 

 
The District Governing Board in 2019 adopted an official diversity statement submitted from the Diversity 
Committee which is as follows:   
 

Coconino Community College recognizes and respects diversity and the value it brings to our com-
munities. We appreciate and welcome cultures, identities, beliefs, experiences, and all that make us 
unique. CCC champions and takes action to build an inclusive work and learning environment. We 
are allies and advocates, navigating a respectful dialogue about our shared humanity.  

 
This diversity statement sets the standard for how the College engages students and staff going forward.  The 
College recognizes that diversity represents any aspect that makes someone unique including, but not limited 
to age, gender, ethnicity, abilities, and sexual orientation.  
 
As a result, the recruitment objective of the Human Resources Department is to cast the widest net possible to 
attract qualified applicants for open positions with the College. The team also focuses on ensuring an unbiased 
and consistent recruitment process for critical faculty and full-time positions. A member of the HR team is 
dedicated to all recruitments to ensure the screening process is consistent for all applicants and aligned to the 
specific job duties of each role, and the process is routinely checked for bias. The team follows the Human Re-
sources Standard protocols for recruitment to also ensure consistency with internal processes.   
 
In addition, the HR talent development program includes a core pillar dedicated to diversity and inclusion. 
Over the past several years, the College has used its online compliance training system, Vector Systems’ Safe 
Colleges, to present programs on diversity and inclusion as well as engaged external national speakers.  
 
Most recently in March 2021, the District Governing Board adopted an official Land Acknowledgement State-
ment as follows: 
 

On behalf of Coconino Community College, we would like to express our gratitude and apprecia-
tion to the sacred land on which this educational institution resides. Sacred sites located within Co-
conino County include the San Francisco Peaks, Oak Creek Canyon, Sedona Red Rocks, the Colo-
rado River, the Little Colorado River, the Colorado River Confluence, the Grand Canyon, and many 
more sites. This land has been inhabited by the Sinagua and Ancestral Pueblo for thousands of 
years. Currently, the Zuni, Apache, Yavapai, Hualapai, Havasupai, Paiute, Diné, Hopi, and many 
other Arizona tribal nations recognize this land as a significant spiritual place. This sacred land is 
enriched with indigenous history and culture that lives on to this day. We, as a community, with our 
CCC family and friends, are very fortunate to live, work, and share this unique location. Thank you.

Introduction—Strategic Planning and Resource Allocation  

CCC follows a planning cycle for continuous improvement. The performance measures help influence the 
development of the strategic plan. The measures and strategic plan together are a large consideration when 
allocating resources during the budget development process and for evaluation of long-term financial planning. 
This cycle is depicted in the graph below.  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
This section of the challenges and solutions will cover the following areas related to Strategic Planning:  
 
Prior Period Strategic Planning Accomplishments 
Review the Strategic Planning accomplishments from the previous year. 
 
Performance Measures  
Review the most recent performance measures and state comparisons. The Arizona community college 
districts developed a Strategic Vision Report to share long-term performance measures to improve access, 
retention, and completion. CCC identified selected performance measures from the annual report to focus on 
for improvement. The College uses the data to inform the Strategic Enrollment Management (SEM) 
Committee and is used in the budget development process.  
 
Strategic Plan 
A one-page summary of the goals and expected outcomes of the new Students First: Vision 2025 plan. The 
College began a two-and-a-half-year planning process for the 2020-2025 strategic plan in 2017. The process 
represented an example of CCC’s shared governance philosophy as all areas of the College were involved in 
developing and vetting the plan. Community members and stakeholders reviewed the plan in the Spring of 
2020 and it was approved by the Board on September 16, 2020.  
 Budget Development 
Several challenges and solutions were identified during the budget planning cycle. This section provides a high
-level overview of selected initiatives that were important considerations in the budget development process as 
well as strategic planning priorities for resource allocation.  
 
Higher Learning Commission Accreditation 
The Higher Learning Commission (HLC) is the accrediting agency that evaluates CCC, makes 
recommendations for improvement, and sets standards for best practices and regulations that Higher Education 
Agencies must follow. This section reviews areas the College identified for improvement to strengthen the 
standards of excellence established by the HLC.

State Performance Measures - Strategic Vision 2030 
In 2010, the presidents of all ten of the Arizona community college districts worked together to develop long-
term performance measures. The document identified 30 metrics to measure progress toward three critical 
goals of access, retention, and completion.  Many of the performance indicators within each goal area are 
based on the American Association of Community Colleges Voluntary Framework of Accountability (VFA). 
The VFA created common measures by which community colleges can be held accountable including student 
progress, outcomes, workforce, economic, and community development metrics.  
 
The performance measures and baseline data were first published in February 2011. The Arizona colleges have 
continued to report on the metrics through 2020 and now have nine years of data. The College uses 
performance measures in the Strategic Enrollment Management (SEM) Committee and is one of the resources 
used in the budget development process. CCC has selected a subset of the Strategic Vision measures to focus 
on and has annual goals for improvement. The most recent comparison of 2020 state and CCC information is 
presented below along with the key indicating colors:

Strategic Enrollment Management (SEM) 
As the College plans for the future and meeting long-term student and community needs, an important part of 
the conversation is the College’s enrollment. CCC’s Strategic Enrollment Management (SEM) Committee 
focuses on targeted recruitment and smart investment of recruitment funds, retention initiatives, and 
completion efforts.  Prior to COVID-19, enrollments had been declining gradually in recent years, and the 
SEM committee closely monitored enrollment reports and used data to inform scheduling decisions. Because 
of the pandemic, FY21 enrollments declined sharply by 20% and SEM also had to factor in remote instruction 
and social distancing where needed for the few CTE classes that were held in person.       
 
Recruitment  
CCC has a Strategic Enrollment Management Recruitment Plan that was approved by the College District 
Governing Board in the Spring of 2020. The plan has five clearly stated objectives that are supported by 
measurable strategies that serve as quantifiable goals. Those strategies are accomplished through tactics, which 
are divided into In-person, Physical Marketing, and/or Digital Marketing. The objectives include increasing: 
the proportion of American Indian or Alaska Native Students, the number of HS2CCC program students, the 
number of Coconino County New to Higher Education students to improve the CCC Community College-
Going Rate, the number of Out-of-District State Resident New to Higher Education students, and the annual 
number of TRANSFER group students. An internal Argos dashboard has been created to provide up-to-date 
data to monitor progress on each strategy. 
 
Retention  
CCC currently has a draft retention plan that is organized in a similar way to the recruitment plan. The draft 
has three objectives: Increase the proportion of New to Higher Education (NTHE) students retained by 10% by 
2025, Increase the proportion of NTHE-CCC students retained by 5% by 2025, and Increase the proportion of 
TRANSFER students retained by 5% by 2025. Each Objective shares three measurable Strategies, each 
intended to increase retention within the corresponding Objective, organized by semester. Each Strategy is 
followed by a Tactics Summary organized around five integrated themes: Data Analytics, Engagement, 
Student Success, Diversity, and Marketing. When the plan is complete, a reporting dashboard will be created.  
 
Summary 
The work of the SEM committee and the Recruitment and Retention subcommittees demonstrate that CCC 
faces some unique challenges due to the large geographic area it covers and the proximity to NAU, but also 
has opportunities for improvement. SEM will continue tracking trends and evaluating initiatives of the 
recruitment and retention subcommittees to strengthen and improve selected performance measures.

Budget Challenges and Resource Allocations 

Budget Development 
As the administration began planning the FY22 budget, a number of challenges and solutions were identified 
and factored into the budget planning cycle. The most significant challenge involved addressing the effects of 
the COVID-19 pandemic. The impacts of the pandemic continued to be unknown or unclear throughout the 
budget development process. The decline in infection rates and federal stimulus funding provided some reason 
for cautious optimism that has been reflected in the budget. The sections below will give a high-level overview 
of selected challenges and initiatives that were important considerations in the budget development process 
and helped to guide resource allocation decisions for FY22. 
 
Decrease in Property, Sales Tax, and In Lieu Taxes 
The closing of the Navajo Generating Station near Page during FY20 had a significant impact on the tax base 
for Coconino County, as well as an impact on the workforce in Page. The FY22 budget reflects a decline in 
property values as the plant was removed from the property tax rolls as well as a reduction of in lieu taxes. The 
long-term economic impact of this closure remains unclear at this time.   
 
Minimum Wage  
On November 8th, 2016, Arizona voters approved Proposition 206, which increased the state minimum wage 
as of January 1st, 2017 from $8.05 to $10.00 per hour. In the same election, the City of Flagstaff voters 
approved Proposition 414 (later amended by City Council), to increase the minimum wage to $2 per hour 
above the state rate. The result of these elections increased the minimum wage by $7.45 per hour up to $15.50 
per hour by January 1st, 2022. The minimum wage increase did not come with increased funding, so part-time 
staff and Federal Work-Study hours have been reduced as increased costs had to be evaluated against other 
College priorities.  
 
Compensation and Cost of Living 
The College is located in Coconino County which has the highest cost of living in the state, specifically the 
City of Flagstaff’s cost of living is 15% higher than the state average. The housing costs are the largest factor 
and are 58% above the state average.  Conversely, the median income is about 4% less than the Arizona 
median, which results in a substantial gap between income and the cost of living in comparison to the rest of 
the state.  This poses challenges for attracting and retaining qualified staff and makes benchmark salary data 
less comparable to the rest of the state for similar positions.  CCC continues to work on providing competitive 
compensation and benefits packages for employees. One way the College addresses this challenge is through 
biennial market studies and resulting adjustments. 
Benefit Costs 
CCC participates in the self funded Northern Arizona Public Employer Benefits Trust. This collaboration 
between the City of Flagstaff, Coconino County, Flagstaff Unified School District, Coconino County Regional 
Accommodation School, and the Northern Arizona Intergovernmental Transit Authority has led to cost 
containment in health insurance rates. The medical contribution rates for FY22 increased by 3%, which was 
absorbed by the College, and is in line with national trends. 
 
Resource Allocation 
Because of the uncertainty of COVID-19 and the decline in enrollment, new resources were not available to 
fund new strategic planning requests for FY22 budget.  The Executive Leadership Council members worked 
with their team members to carefully evaluate budgets and reallocate resources to advance priorities in the new 
strategic plan. In addition, the College has a three-year plan to use one-time state funds as seed start-up costs 
associated with new or expanding programs requested by students and community members. The following 
pages highlight selected tactics from the new strategic plan and the respective resource allocation plans.

Challenges and Solutions—Strengthen Accreditation Standards 

Higher Learning Commission  
The Higher Learning Commission (HLC) is the accrediting Agency that evaluates CCC, makes 
recommendations for improvement, and sets standards for best practices and regulations that Higher Education 
Agencies must follow. HLC has helped the College identify areas where we can better meet the standards of 
excellence established by the HLC. These areas include the establishment of an assessment program at the 
College that will be sustainable over time, enhanced online course delivery, increased full-time faculty 
teaching courses, reviewing faculty credentialing standards, and continuous improvement on completion rates. 
Assessment of Student Learning 
To meet the goal of improved assessment of student learning, CCC has participated in the HLC Quality 
Initiative program.  CCC staff have completed the HLC Assessment Academy, and through these efforts have 
developed a plan to make learning outcomes assessment meaningful at the program level in order to improve 
academic quality at the College. The College is creating an assessment culture, and incorporating assessment 
into the Program Review process.   
 
Online Course Delivery 
The Teaching and Learning Center (TLC) at CCC took on the critical task of formalizing our modality for 
online course delivery. They worked closely with faculty to develop a common course template which helped 
to standardize the online experience for our students. Faculty scheduled face to face meetings with TLC 
members mostly throughout the Fall 2017 semester. By the Spring of 2018, 95% of CCC faculty had 
converted to the new standardized online experience. This project has helped to increase online enrollment, 
and the College plans to improve the experience with regular faculty follow-up meetings. COVID-19 has 
accelerated this conversion.   
 
Full-Time Faculty 
The ratio of credits taught by full-time faculty compared to part-time faculty at CCC is lower than best 
practices would recommend. Additionally, the College currently offers some subjects in areas where there are 
no full-time faculty.  CCC has been addressing this by adding full-time faculty over the past three years, for a 
total of nine new full-time faculty in the budget between Fiscal Year 2017 through Fiscal Year 2019.  One-
time rural funding has been earmarked to add faculty for the marine and vet tech programs; however, COVID- 
19 has delayed implementation of these programs. 
 
Faculty Credentials 
The HLC has created mandatory credentialing requirements for faculty. In order to meet this requirement, 
CCC created a credentialing committee, evaluated the credentials of all full-time and part-time faculty, and 
created an individual action plan for each faculty member that did not meet standards. Some faculty chose to 
enhance their education in order to meet the requirements to continue teaching their current courses, other 
chose to teach in only the subjects where they were credentialed, and a few decided not to continue their status 
as a CCC faculty member. The College chose to help support faculty credentials for some faculty that needed 
additional credits by offering targeted tuition reimbursements outside of what is normally offered in the 
employee benefits package. Moving forward, a procedure has been implemented that requires all newly hired 
instructors to meet minimum credential standards before being considered for hire. 
 
Completion 
There are many factors that result in community colleges nation wide reporting lower completion rates than 
four-year institutions. CCC has a lower than average completion rate, but the rate has been consistently 
improving over the past several years due to College retention and completion initiatives.

Budget Development Process 
Budget Organization 
An explanation of funds and programs codes is described below. 
 
Funds 
There are five funds that make up the College’s all Funds budget. 

 General Fund - Used to account for all general operations of the College and is the largest fund. 
 Auxiliary Fund - Used to account for self-supporting activities that perform a service to students. 
 Restricted Fund - Used to account for resources that are restricted by outside donors or agencies 

such as grants, contracts, and financial aid. 
 Unexpended Plant Fund - Used to account for equipment or the construction or improvement of 

buildings.    
 Retirement of Indebtedness - Used to account for the resources for payment of principal and 

interest on debt. 
 
Program Codes 

 Instruction - Activities directly related to instruction including faculty salaries, benefits, and 
supplies. 

 Public Service - Non-instructional services beneficial to individuals or groups external to the 
institution. 

 Academic Support - Activities that support instruction including libraries, academic computing, 
curriculum development, and deans’ offices. 

 Student Services - Non-instructional, student-related activities such as recruitment, admissions, 
advising, career counseling, financial aid, and student clubs and organizations.  

 Institutional Support - General administrative services such as executive management, legal and 
fiscal operations, human resources, and public relations. 

 Scholarships - Institutional spending on scholarships, including federal financial aid from 
restricted funds. 

 Plant Operations and Maintenance - Service and maintenance of the physical plant, buildings 
and grounds, utilities, and property insurance. 

 
Basis of Budgeting 
The College primarily uses an incremental budget process. An incremental budget means that the prior year 
base budgets are the starting point, and incremental changes are made to the base budget when not covered by 
reallocations of funds. Budget requests are prioritized based on strategic planning initiatives and performance 
measures, then reviewed and recommended by the Executive Leadership Council to the District Governing 
Board for adoption.  The College also uses a zero-base budget process for travel and other account categories 
on a rotational basis. Zero-base means that the budget begins with “zero” and all expenditures must be 
justified. 
 
Controls 
The College maintains budgetary controls by line item of the approved budget. An encumbrance accounting 
system is maintained by the College to accomplish budgetary control. Open encumbrances are not reported as 
reservations of fund balance at year-end, but are liquidated (lapse at year-end). Encumbrances are re-
established at the beginning of the next fiscal year as an obligation against the current year’s adopted budget. 



31 

Annual Financial Plan  
 

Budget Development Process (continued) 
Budget Process 
In previous years, the Budget Planning Committee guided the budget process.  Beginning with the FY18 
budget development process, budget hearings were introduced to help develop transparency throughout the 
College. Each year, feedback is solicited and is incorporated into the budget development process to further 
participation and transparency. For the FY19 planning process, the District Governing Board (DGB) 
requested that all budget information be presented in one comprehensive retreat, rather than through a series 
of work sessions. This was implemented and positively received by the Board. The new budget process 
continues to ensure that the goals and objectives from the strategic plan are prioritized when creating the 
budgets for the year.  The Executive Leadership Council reviews budget requests and recommends increments 
included in the preliminary budget presented to the DGB.  
 
A summary of the new budget development process is listed below and is explained in more detail on the 
following pages: 
 

 October - Develop budget assumptions and present to budget managers, this is open to all 
employees  

 November - Distribute tuition and fee schedules, base budgets, travel justification forms, and 
budget increment request forms to budget managers  

 December - Council areas discuss and prioritize budget increment requests with input from staff 
 December - Tuition and fee recommendations, base budget reallocations, travel justification forms, 

and budget increment request forms due to Business Office 
 January - DGB budget retreat 
 February - Survey students regarding tuition recommendations 
 February - Budget hearings to aid Executive Leadership Council with prioritizing requests 
 February - DGB adopts tuition and fees and provides direction on salary and benefits 
 April - DGB reviews preliminary budget  
 May - DGB final budget adoption  
 May - College-wide budget presentation 
 

Assumptions 
Beginning assumptions are established as a starting point for developing the budget and are developed in     
October of each year.  Below are general guidelines for developing the beginning assumptions each year: 
 

Revenues 
 Enrollment - growth of 0.5% per year based on long-term county population trends, adjusted for 

current enrollment decline 
 Tuition - CPI increase of standard tuition rate as directed by the Board, other rates are a multiplier 

of the standard rate 
 State Aid - Per state formula, depends on a decrease or increase of enrollment in prior years 
 Property taxes - 2.0% maximum allowed increase in levy plus 1.0% new construction added to the 

tax rolls based on trend 
 Other Revenue - CPI and/or enrollment-based  
Expenses 
 Salary and benefits are assumed to increase depending on the cost of living and CPI, adjusting part-

time faculty for current enrollment. Medical benefits increase per trend. 
 All other expense categories excluding salaries and benefits have 2% planned increases. 



32 

Annual Financial Plan  

 

Budget Retreat 
In January, a DGB budget retreat is held to review budget trends, tuition and fees, salary and benefit 
recommendations, and preliminary budget increment priorities. This process has been successful because it 
gives the DGB a comprehensive budget picture, and allows them to consider multiple related budget factors 
when adopting tuition and fee recommendations and providing compensation guidance. 
 
REVENUES 
 
Enrollment  
Enrollment projections are based on trend analysis and County projections for population growth, as well as 
the DGB enrollment goals and program changes.  
 
Tuition and Fees  
Tuition and fees, including differential tuition rates and non-class fees, are reviewed in November and 
December. Academic Deans review differential tuition rates for higher-cost programs, market data, and 
instructional expenses to determine if increases to differential tuition rates will be recommended.  Other fees, 
such as parking fees, are also reviewed by respective areas and compared to the market to determine if changes 
will be recommended. Trend analysis of enrollment within the different rates of tuition is used to project 
tuition revenue.  
 
Tuition and fee recommendations are taken to the DGB budget retreat for review and to receive direction. The 
Board approves tuition and fees rates in February for the next academic year.  
 
State Appropriation Aid 
State aid is calculated per formula which is “base plus growth.” The base is the prior year’s state aid. The 
growth or loss is calculated by the increase or decrease in full-time student equivalent (FTSE) between the two 
most recent fiscal years in each category of non-dual enrollment and dual enrollment. The growth or loss in 
FTSE is multiplied by the given rate per category. One FTSE equals an average of 15 credit hours in each of 
the fall and spring semesters, for a total of 30 credits hours for one year.  Dual enrollment FTSE is funded at 
half the rate of non-dual enrollment FTSE. State appropriations are not guaranteed and the State has 
discontinued general operational funding for the two largest community college districts, increasing the 
uncertainty of this funding source. 
 
State STEM Appropriation  
Beginning in FY14, the state began providing STEM appropriations to some Arizona community colleges. 
This STEM aid restricted to science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and workforce programs. The 
formula is $210 per 30 credits of non-dual enrollment and $105 per 30 credits of dual enrollment.  
 
Property Taxes  
By February 10th of each year, the County Assessor’s Office provides assessed valuations needed to calculate 
the primary and secondary property tax levies. The primary levy cannot exceed the prior year levy by more 
than two percent plus new construction added to the tax rolls. Due to CCC’s low tax rate, the Board typically 
adopts the maximum allowed tax levy.  
 
Grants and Contracts 
Grants and contracts mostly include revenue from federal and state grants that have been awarded to the 
College.  Special meetings are held with individual grant program managers and the Grants Accountant to 
develop the upcoming budgets based on the anticipated funding level for the grant or program.

Sales and Services 
Sales and services revenue is budgeted in the Auxiliary Services Fund and is projected using minimum 
guarantees and estimates based on trend information.  For example, funding from vending machines is used to 
support student activities and employee functions.   
 
Investment  Income 
Investment income is earned on balances invested with the County Treasurer and State Local Government 
Investment Pool.  This revenue is budgeted using projected fund balance and estimated rate of return. 
 
EXPENSES 
 
Salary and Benefits  
Salary and benefits are the largest expenditure of the College and account for approximately 50% of the   
General Fund budget. The Board has directed staff to conduct a salary survey every other year. In alternate 
years, employees and supervisors can request position reviews or reclassifications. The Board reviews salary 
and benefit information at the budget retreat and provides final direction at the March meeting. Board direction 
includes changes for CPI, degree attainment, market, minimum wage increases, and reclassifications for 
faculty and staff. 
 
The Arizona State Retirement System (ASRS) posts the required employee and employer contribution rates 
each year. 
 
Health benefits are determined through the Northern Arizona Public Employees Benefit Trust (NAPEBT) 
which is a trust formed by local public employers to provide cost-effective benefits packages to their 
employees. The benefits covered include self-funded health, vision, pharmacy, and traditional life and dental 
insurance.  
 
Travel 
All travel expenses are zero-based annually, meaning that travel must be requested and justified each year. 
Travel expenses include in-district, in-state, and professional development. Professional development travel is 
allocated on an FTE basis to full-time positions.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Since Professional Development fund allocations do not cover all the costs of attending conferences, 
supervisors and budget managers typically pool the funds and alternate which employees are able to receive 
funds from year to year based on College and department priorities.  
 
Preventative Maintenance (Life Cycle Replacement)  
The College allocates funds for preventative maintenance projects annually, based on a cost per square foot 
indexed by the CPI.  Allocated funds not used in any one year are rolled over and reserved for future 
preventative maintenance projects. This process allows the College to set funds aside annually for larger 
projects.

Annual Financial Plan  

 

Budget Development Process (continued) 

The College has preventative maintenance schedules for 20 years that include major maintenance and 
replacement of items such as HVAC units, roofs, parking lots, and carpeting. The Executive Director of       
Facilities and Security assesses the condition of the facilities and adjusts the schedules annually, or as needed, 
to ensure the facilities are maintained and the life and safety of the students and staff are protected.  Any 
capital items that improve or extend the life of the facilities and are over $5,000 are capitalized and budgeted 
in the plant fund. 
 
Academic Support Technology  
In FY17, a $7 per credit hour technology fee was combined into the base tuition rate. The Information 
Technology Services department uses the funds to pay for small equipment, software, and maintenance 
agreements for the instructional, academic support, and student services program codes. Requests for 
technology purchases are reviewed during budget hearings.  
 
Equipment   
The College allocates funding for equipment annually depending upon available funding, recent allocations are  
as follows:  
 ITS Equipment - Beginning in FY18, the College set aside $140,000 annually to fund short-term and long-

term IT life cycle replacement plans. In FY21, this technology replacement budget was reduced by 
$20,000 to $120,000, to reallocate funds to academic support for increases in annual maintenance 
agreements.  In FY22, the ITS department used carryforward reserves for planned purchases and no 
additional funds were allocated.  

 Other Equipment - In FY20, the College budgeted $53,400 for other equipment and one-time requests.  For 
FY21, the College reallocated the other equipment budget to help support salary and benefit increases, as 
well as, other expenses without increasing the overall budget. 

 STEM Equipment - In FY20, the College budgeted $287,400 for STEM equipment funding. Requests for 
STEM funding were submitted and prioritized by Executive Council based on strategic planning initiatives 
and performance measures. For FY21, the College reallocated the STEM equipment budget to help support 
salary and benefit increases, as well as, other expenses without increasing the overall budget.   

 
President’s Contingency Fund  
An allowance of $100,000 is budgeted for unforeseen expenditures and is approved by the President. Some of 
the funds can be used to provide a funding mechanism for faculty, staff, and students in developing and 
implementing innovative projects that will generate revenue, create savings or technological solutions, 
improve services to students, and/or advance strategic planning initiatives.  
  
Carryforward 
In FY18, the College increased the carryforward budget to $2 million for emergencies. For FY21, the College 
increased the carryforward to $3 million due to the uncertainties of the COVID-19 pandemic.

All Funds - Fund Balance Reserves 

The purpose of the College’s fund balance procedure is to establish a targeted amount for the general fund and 
fund balance reserves. The goal is to achieve sustainability reserves equal to 33% of total budgeted revenues. 
The fund balance also provides cash flow liquidity for general operations. It is important to maintain adequate 
levels of unreserved fund balance to mitigate financial risk that can occur from unforeseen revenue 
fluctuations, unanticipated expenditures, cash flow management, emergency contingency, and Plant Fund 
designations. The table below lists reserves for each fund.   
 
General Fund—The reserves include accumulated sustainability reserves and carryforward funds that allow a 
portion of the fund balance to be spent in the current year if needed. Additionally, the general fund includes 
carryforward funds from one-time state allocations. The College planned to use the one-time funds as seed 
money to start new programs over three years, the remaining one-third of $352,188 is reserved for FY23.   
 
Auxiliary Fund—Reserves primarily for future replacement of student calculators     
 
Plant Fund—Reserves for future building maintenance of replacement of capital equipment 
 
Debt Service—Restricted reserves resulting from delinquent property tax collections from the secondary levy 
 
The all funds sustainability reserves is below the targeted 33% primarily due to the one-time federal 
emergency stimulus funding. Since it is one-time funding, the current reserves should be adequate to meet the 
operational and liquidity needs of the College.

The charts below show a 10-year history of the difference from revenues and expenses that were added to net 
position (reserves) for the College.  The significant decrease in net position in FY15 was due to GASB 68 
pension adjustments.

Annual Financial Plan 

The General Fund has three major revenue sources: student tuition and fees, state appropriations, and property tax-
es.  The chart below depicts the changes in these revenue sources over a ten-year period showing an increase 
in state appropriations due to the one-time rural appropriation and a one-time Transwestern appropriation for 
FY22.   

General Fund - Revenues 

Tuition and Fee revenue for FY22 is based on a projected State FTSE of 1,763. Enrollment in Community 
Colleges tends to be counter-cyclical to the economy. During a down economy, unemployed workers look to 
reskill at community colleges and prepare to reenter the job market. That pattern did not hold true during the 
pandemic as shown in the graph below where CCC experienced a 20% drop in FTSE in FY21. Part of the 
decline was due to out-of-state web students that the state excludes from the FTSE calculation. The FY22 
projected FTSE anticipates some recovery in enrollments with the return of in-person classes.  



 

42 

Annual Financial Plan 

General Fund - Tuition and Fee Revenue 
In FY11, CCC was forced to implement a large tuition increase of 13 percent due to the decline in state 
appropriation. Since FY13, the College has been able to maintain lower tuition increases as shown in the chart 
below. The Board did not increase tuition for FY22 because of the pandemic.   

Coconino Community College’s annual tuition is below national and regional averages; however, it is the 
highest in the state. The comparison below shows CCC annual tuition compared to the other College’s in the 
state and as previously discussed this is primarily due to having the lowest property tax rate in the state.

For FY22, the District Governing Board choose to maintain standard resident tuition rates, but increased the Out-
of-County rate by 5%, to a total of 20% over the in-county rate. The Western Undergraduate Exchange (WUE) 
program and Out-of-State tuition rates are based on a multiplier of 1.5 and 3.5 of the standard rate, respectively. 
The Board also approved adding a new differential tuition level for $40 to assist with an increase in nursing costs. 
The differential tuition rate charges higher tuition rates to higher-cost programs. The 2021-2022 Tuition Schedule 
below shows the standard rates and differential tuition rates for each level and residency category.

Steep declines in state aid began in 1998 due to the struggling economy and decreased tourist activity. The 
State Full-Time Student Equivalent (FTSE) funding for FY22 has decreased by $72,000 from the prior year 
based on the statutory formula. State appropriations are received based on FTSE formula funding.  This formula 
funding provides $590 per FTSE (30 credit hours per year) while dual enrollment is only calculated at fifty percent 
or $295 per FTSE.  State appropriations are received on a two-year lag based on enrollment growth or decline.  The 
state appropriations funding formula does adjust for inflation nor more costly career and technical programs.   
While the State FTSE appropriation decreased for FY22, the overall state appropriation increased due to one-
time rural and one-time Transwestern appropriations.

The tax levy is calculated per Arizona Revised Statutes (A.R.S.) §42-17051.  Assessed property values fall into two 
tax levy categories, property on the tax rolls in the current year and newly completed construction being added to 
the rolls.  
 
The assessed value of all property for the current tax year tends to reflect values of properties 18 months 
before the taxes are levied.  Property assessments begin in February, and a notice of value is provided to each 
property owner the following January for the value that will be taxed in the upcoming year, based on 
assessments started in the prior year.  
 
The Arizona Constitution limits the increase in the District’s tax levy on current assessed property to 2% per year 
shown on line 2. When the assessed values of all property increase by more than 2%, then the tax rate is forced 
down resulting in declining tax rates as shown on line 4. Then the derived tax rates are applied to the new 
construction. New construction growth averages approximately 1% per year. However, it is important to note that 
for FY22, the Salt River Project Navajo Generation Station was decommissioned and the property values were 
subtracted from new construction. This resulted in a lower maximum levy shown online 8. Because of the low 
tax rate and long-term financial challenges, the Board typically approves the maximum allowed tax levy.  
 
Finally, adjustments to the statutory calculation include in-lieu and excise taxes that the college is eligible for to 
come to the budgeted property taxes.  
 
Because of the low property tax rate, CCC Board has approved the maximum levy each year.

The College is required to submit financial ratios annually to the Higher Learning Commission (HLC), the 
College’s accrediting body, to measure the College’s financial health.  The financial ratios are defined below 
and the charts are inclusive of GASB 68 Pension and GASB 75 OPEB adjustments: 
 

 Primary Reserve Ratio: A measure of how long the institution could operate using             
expendable reserves 

 Net Operating Revenue Ratio:  A measure if operating activities provide a surplus or deficit   
 Viability:  The availability of expendable net assets to pay off debt at any point in time 
 Return on Net Assets:  Determines the total return on investment of net assets for the year   
 Composite:  Weighted average score to determine overall financial health 
 

Although temporarily dampened from the impacts of the pandemic, the College’s financial ratios have 
generally been improving through strong financial management.  The viability ratio decreased to zero due to 
paying off the College’s debt in FY19. The decreases in both the net operating revenue and return on net asset 
ratios for FY20 are primarily due to timing of impacts of COVID-19 for the College and timing and 
recognition of a large grant received by the Foundation in 2019. The composite score, which must be above 
1.1 to avoid a potential HLC review, decreased slightly from last year to 6.07, which means that the College is 
still in a relatively healthy financial position based on the current business model.

Long-Term Capital Outlook 
Facilities Preventative Maintenance/Life Cycle Replacement  
The College allocates funds for preventative maintenance projects and life cycle replacement annually, based 
on a cost per square foot indexed by the CPI. The College has twenty year planned maintenance schedules that 
include major maintenance and replacement of items such as HVAC units, roofs, parking lots, and carpeting. 
The Executive Director of Facilities & Security assesses the condition of the facilities and adjusts the sched-
ules as needed to ensure the facilities are maintained and the life and safety of the students and staff are pro-
tected. Allocated funds not used in any one year are rolled over and reserved for future planned maintenance 
projects. This process allows the College to set funds aside annually for larger  projects.    
 
The College has been able to maintain this system of setting aside funds annually for preventative maintenance 
projects even during the state budget cuts and plans to continue to use this method in the future.  The chart  
below depicts the upcoming five year project schedule from the 20-year maintenance schedule:

Risk Analysis 

COVID-19 
As noted throughout the budget document the COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on College 
services and operations. Beginning March 2020, a majority of classes shifted to remote delivery modalities to 
protect the health and safety of students and employees. The College experienced a 20% decline in state FTSE 
for FY21 as many students opted out of online learning. However, included in the decline were out-of-state 
web students that do not count toward the state FTSE calculations. For Fall semester 2021, the College is 
planning to return to 50% in-person classes. Mitigation efforts include requiring signed waivers for on campus 
students, expecting masks and social distancing, and additional sanitizing. The Federal Emergency Relief 
funds continue to help the College offset additional operating costs and lost revenues caused by the pandemic. 
 
Security and Insurance Risks 
The College is required to collect and store student data as part of maintaining compliance with various 
regulatory requirements. Some of this information is considered Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and 
is subject to more stringent privacy regulations. Recent cyber events in Arizona have cost educational 
institutions millions of dollars to correct. This risk area will require a continuous proactive approach by the 
College to protect the data of our students, faculty, and staff.  

Due to the possibility of exposure to various risks of loss related to torts, theft of, damage to, and destruction 
of assets, errors and omissions, injuries to employees, cybersecurity risks, and natural disasters, the College 
carries commercial insurance for all such risks of loss, including workers’ compensation, employee health, and 
accident insurance.  Most recently, the College has included insurance on cybersecurity risks.  Settled claims 
resulting from these risks have not exceeded commercial insurance coverage in any of the past three fiscal 
years.  
 
Economy 
The City of Page is facing the impacts of the closure of the Navajo Generating Station that occurred in 
December 2019. The closure affected over 900 employees and the College worked with the Salt River Project 
to offer educational opportunities for employees. For FY22 the Navajo Generating Station was 
decommissioned and the property was removed from the tax rolls. The long term impacts on the economy in

Compliance Risks 
As unit of local government of the state of Arizona, the College is subject to statutes and regulatory 
requirements prescribed by the state.  As a higher education institution that awards Federal Title IV financial 
aid funds, Federal regulatory changes for disbursing funds and reporting on students can have significant 
impacts on the College. Other federal grants also come with reporting and outcome requirements. As 
regulations change, the College must remain flexible in how business operations are modified to maintain 
compliance. 

Minimum Wage Risk 
External legislative changes can also impact the College.  On November 8th, 2016, Arizona voters approved 
Proposition 206, which increased the state minimum wage as of January 1st, 2017 from $8.05 to $10.00 per 
hour, as well as providing earned sick time for every 30 hours of work time to all employees starting July 1st, 
2017.  Also on November 8th, the City of Flagstaff voters approved Proposition 414 (later amended by City 
Council), to increase minimum wage to $2 per hour above the state rate, to eventually a $15.50 per hour 
minimum wage by January 2022. There is an implementation plan that phases in these changes.  This did not 
come with increases funding for Federal Work Study students, so those hours have been, and will continue to 
be, significantly impacted by the increase in minimum wage. Part-time staff hours have been reduced, and will 
require prioritizing those costs against other needs in the future.

Risk Analysis (continued) 

 
Benefit Risks 
The Affordable Care Act (ACA), postemployment health care benefits, Arizona State Retirement System, 
and GASB 68 pension liability reporting are additional risks to the College and other employers.  The ACA 
mandates that all part-time employees are offered medical insurance benefits when they become eligible. If 
the College fails to offer benefits, significant penalties could be imposed.  The postemployment healthcare 
benefits reporting regulations require the liability of benefits to be amortized over 30 years.  Due to rising 
health care costs and overall utilization, the liability may continue to increase as more retirees stay in the 
insurance pool.  

The Arizona State Retirement System is an uncontrollable risk the College faces because it is administered 
by the ASRS Board.  The College has no control over the yearly expenditures. As a result of Governmental 
Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 68, the College had to restate unrestricted net position as of July 
1, 2014, in order to recognize pension liability. In the future this could possibly have an impact on 
accreditation ratios, bond rating, contribution rates, and future capital raising potential. 

The College provides life, accidental death and dismemberment, disability, medical, and dental insurance    
benefits to its employees and their dependents through a pooled trust, the Northern Arizona Public 
Employees Benefit Trust (NAPEBT), currently composed of the City of Flagstaff, Coconino County, 
Coconino County Accommodation School District, Flagstaff Housing Authority, Flagstaff Unified School 
District, Northern Arizona Intergovernmental Public Transportation Authority (NAIPTA), and the College. 
NAPEBT is self-funded through an agreement with the participating members and NAPEBT administers the 
plan. The members’ employee and employer contributions are paid to fund benefits and administrative 
expenses. If the College withdraws from NAPEBT, it is responsible for its proportionate share of any claims 
run-out costs, including claims reported but not settled, claims incurred but not reported, and administrative 
costs. If NAPEBT were to terminate, the College would be responsible for its proportional share of any trust 
deficit. 
 
High Cost of Technology 
Students expect a high level of technology in classrooms and labs as well as easy to use applications for     
navigating College processes. The cost of hardware and software is expensive, as is the annual maintenance 
costs for the technology. In addition, expensive specialized consultants are needed, to keep current with  
changes and to implement new technology and to maintain low cyber risks. Finally, there is a high cost 
associated with keeping technical staff constantly trained and current with new technologies. To mitigate the 
risk of the high cost technology, the College has prioritized funding to maintain current technology and fund 
the long-term replacement plan.

The College must follow several state laws in the development of the budget, as follows: 
 
Budget  
The College is required to prepare an annual budget on forms designated by the Auditor General’s Office,  
hold a Special Budget Hearing, and adopt the budget by no later than June 20th.  [ARS § 15-1461] 
 
Expenditure Limitations  
Each year, an expenditure limitation is set for political subdivisions of the State of Arizona per ARS § 41-563. 
The expenditure limitation is based on FY 1979/80 and adjusted for changes in the population and cost of liv-
ing between 1978 and 2012.  The purpose of the expenditure limitation is to limit budget growth that is sup-
ported by property taxes and/or state aid.  
 
Property Tax Levy limitations  
In 1980, the citizens amended the Arizona State Constitution and capped primary property tax increases from 
existing property to 2% per year. The purpose was to limit tax increases to small amounts.  
 
Truth-in-Taxation  
In a 1996 legislative session, a Truth-in-Taxation statute was passed requiring political subdivisions to publish 
notice of and to hold public hearings on proposed tax increases on existing property.  
 
Debt  
Any debt increase by a local government that is paid exclusively through the secondary property tax must be  
approved by voters.
