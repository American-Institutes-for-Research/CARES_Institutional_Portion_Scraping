Report of Independent Auditors on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and on 
Compliance and Other Matters Based on an Audit of Financial Statements Performed 

in Accordance with Government Auditing Standards 

 
To the Board of Trustees of The University of Alabama: 
 
We have audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of 
America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing 
Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of the 
business-type activities and the discretely presented component unit of The University of Alabama 
in Huntsville (“UAH”), a campus of The University of Alabama System, which is a component unit 
of the State of Alabama, which comprise the statements of net position as of September 30, 2020, 
and the related statements of revenues, expenses, and changes in net position and of cash flows 
(where applicable) for the year then ended, and the related notes to the  financial statements, and 
have issued our report thereon dated January 21, 2021. Our report includes an emphasis of a matter 
regarding the presentation of the financial statements as discussed in Note 1 to the financial 
statements. Our report includes a reference to other auditors who audited the financial statements 
of The University of Alabama in Huntsville Foundation (“UAHF”), as described in our report on 
UAH’s financial statements.  The financial statements of UAHF were not audited in accordance with 
Government Auditing Standards, and accordingly, this report does not include reporting on 
internal control over financial reporting or instances of reportable noncompliance associated with 
UAHF.   
 
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered UAH’s internal 
control over financial reporting (“internal control”) to determine the audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial 
statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of UAH's internal 
control.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of UAH's internal control. 
 
A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow 
management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, 
or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a 
combination of deficiencies, in internal control such that there is a reasonable possibility that a 
material misstatement of the entity's financial statements will not be prevented or detected and 
corrected on a timely basis.  A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of 
deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough 
to merit attention by those charged with governance. 
 
Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of 
this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be 
material weaknesses or significant deficiencies.  Given these limitations, during our audit we did 
not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses.  
However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified.

Compliance and Other Matters 
 
As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether UAH’s financial statements are free from 
material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, 
regulations, contracts and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and 
material effect on the determination of financial statement amounts.  However, providing an 
opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit, and accordingly, we 
do not express such an opinion.  The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or 
other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards. 
 
Purpose of this Report 
 
The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and 
compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
entity’s internal control or on compliance.  This report is an integral part of an audit performed in 
accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the entity’s internal control and 
compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

Report of Independent Auditors on Compliance with Requirements  
That Could Have a Direct and Material Effect on Each Major Program and on Internal Control 

Over Compliance in Accordance with the Uniform Guidance  
 

To the Board of Trustees of The University of Alabama: 
 
Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program 
 
We have audited The University of Alabama in Huntsville’s (“UAH”), a campus of The University of 
Alabama System, which is a component unit of the State of Alabama, compliance with the types of 
compliance requirements described in the OMB Compliance Supplement that could have a direct 
and material effect on each of UAH’s major federal programs for the year ended September 30, 
2020.  UAH’s major federal programs are identified in the summary of auditor’s results section of 
the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs. 
 
Management’s Responsibility 
 
Management is responsible for compliance with federal statutes, regulations and the terms and 
conditions of its federal awards applicable to its federal programs.   
 
Auditors’ Responsibility 
 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of UAH’s major federal programs 
based on our audit of the types of compliance requirements referred to above.  We conducted our 
audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States 
of America; the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing 
Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and the audit requirements of 
Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost 
Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). Those standards and 
the Uniform Guidance require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether noncompliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that 
could have a direct and material effect on a major federal program occurred.  An audit includes 
examining, on a test basis, evidence about UAH’s compliance with those requirements and 
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.   
 
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for each major 
federal program. However, our audit does not provide a legal determination of UAH’s compliance. 
 
Opinion on Each Major Federal Program 
 
In our opinion, The University of Alabama at Huntsville complied, in all material respects, with the 
types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on 
each of its major federal programs for the year ended September 30, 2020.

Report on Internal Control Over Compliance 
 
Management of UAH is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over 
compliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above. In planning and 
performing our audit of compliance, we considered UAH’s internal control over compliance with the 
types of requirements that could have a direct and material effect on each major federal program to 
determine the auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on compliance for each major federal program and to test and report on 
internal control over compliance in accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose 
of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance.  Accordingly, we 
do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of UAH‘s internal control over compliance. 
 
A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control 
over compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing 
their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance 
requirement of a federal program on a timely basis.  A material weakness in internal control over 
compliance is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such 
that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance 
requirement of a federal program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely 
basis.  A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination 
of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a 
federal program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over compliance, 
yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.   
  
Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the 
first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control 
over compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. We did not identify 
any deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses.  

However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. 
 
The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our 
testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements 
of the Uniform Guidance.  Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.  
 
Report on Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards Required by the Uniform Guidance  
 
We have audited the financial statements of the business-type activities and the discretely 
presented component unit of UAH as of and for the year ended September 30, 2020, and the 
related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise UAH’s basic financial 
statements.  We issued our report thereon dated January 21, 2021, which contained unmodified 
opinions on those financial statements.  Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming 
opinions on the financial statements that collectively comprise the basic financial statements.  The 
accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal awards is presented for purposes of additional 
analysis as required by the Uniform Guidance and is not a required part of the basic financial 
statements.  Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and 
relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial 
statements.  The information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of 
the financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling 
such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic

financial statements or to the basic financial statements themselves, and other additional 
procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of 
America.  In our opinion, the schedule of expenditures of federal awards is fairly stated, in all 
material respects, in relation to the basic financial statements as a whole.

For the Year Ended September 30, 2020

1. Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (the “Schedule”) summarizes the 
expenditures of The University of Alabama in Huntsville (the “University”), a campus of the 
University of Alabama System, under programs of the federal government for the year ended 
September 30, 2020.  Other campuses of the University of Alabama System are presented in 
separate reports.  The information presented in this Schedule is presented on the accrual basis of 
accounting, which is in accordance with the Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, 
Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards 
(Uniform Guidance).  Because the Schedule presents only the federal award activity of the 
University, it is not intended to and does not present the financial position, changes in net position 
and cash flows of the University.  

The only component unit of the University is the University of Alabama in Huntsville Foundation.  
This component unit is not subject to requirements of the Uniform Guidance as it does not receive 
federal awards; therefore, it is not included within the Schedule or this report. 

For purposes of this Schedule, federal awards include all grants, contracts, and similar agreements 
entered into directly between the University and agencies and departments of the federal 
government and all sub-awards to the University by nonfederal organizations pursuant to federal 
grants, contracts, and similar agreements. 

Negative numbers in the Schedule represent adjustments to amounts reported in prior years in the 
normal course of business.  The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (“CFDA”) and pass-
through numbers have been provided to the extent they were available. 

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

For purposes of the Schedule, expenditures for federal award programs are recognized on the 
accrual basis of accounting. Such expenditures are recognized following the cost principles 
contained in the Uniform Guidance where certain types of expenditures are not allowable or are 
limited to reimbursement. 

3. Facilities and Administrative Costs (“F&A Costs”) 

The University has elected not to use the 10-percent de minimis indirect cost rate allowed under 
the Uniform Guidance.  The University operates under predetermined fixed F&A cost rates which 
are effective from October 1, 2020 through September 30, 2024.  Per 2 CFR 200.414 (g) a rate 
extension has been granted. The predetermined fixed rates were based on 2015 financial 
information.  For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, the base rate for on-campus research 
is 48% and 50% for Department of Defense contracts and subcontracts.  Base rates for other F&A 
cost recoveries range from 10.0% to 50.0%.

4. Federal Student Loan Programs 

The Nurse Faculty Loan Program (NFLP) is administered directly by the University, and balances 
and transactions relating to these programs are included in the University’s financial statements.  
NFLP loans outstanding at the beginning of the year, the administrative cost allowance and loans 
made during the year are included in the federal expenditures presented in the Schedule.  The 
balance of loans outstanding at September 30, 2020 consists of: 

CFDA # Amount 

Student Loan Balance, September 30, 2020  Nursing Faculty Loan  93.264 $656,258 

The Federal Direct Student Loan Program (FDSLP) was established under the Higher Education 
Act of 1965, as amended in the Student Loan Reform Act of 1993.  The FDSLP enables an eligible 
student or parent to obtain a Federal direct loan to pay for the student’s cost of attendance directly 
through the University rather than through private lenders.  As a university qualified to originate 
loans, the University is responsible for handling the complete loan process, including funds 
management as well as promissory note functions.  The University is not responsible for collection 
of these loans.  The FDSLP loans issued during fiscal year 2020 are included in the federal 
expenditures presented in the Schedule.

Report of Independent Auditors 
 
To the Board of Trustees of The University of Alabama: 
 
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the business-type activities and the discretely 
presented component unit of The University of Alabama in Huntsville (“UAH”), a campus of The 
University of Alabama System, which is a component unit of the State of Alabama, which comprise the 
statements of net position as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, and the related statements of revenues, 
expenses, and changes in net position and of cash flows (where applicable) for the years then ended, and 
the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise UAH’s basic financial 
statements.    
 
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements 
 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in 
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes 
the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair 
presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error. 
 
Auditors’ Responsibility 
 
Our responsibility is to express opinions on the financial statements based on our audits.  We did not 
audit the financial statements of The University of Alabama in Huntsville Foundation (“UAHF”), UAH’s 
discretely presented component unit, as of and for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019. Those 
statements were audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, 
insofar as it relates to the amounts included for UAHF, is based solely on the report of the other auditors.  
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States 
of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing 
Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States.  Those standards require that we 
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are 
free from material misstatement.  The financial statements of UAHF were not audited in accordance with 
Government Auditing Standards. 
 
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on our judgment, including the assessment of 
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.  In making 
those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to UAH’s preparation and fair presentation 
of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, 
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of UAH’s internal control.   
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of 
accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by 
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.  We believe that 
the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinions. 
 
Opinions 
 
In our opinion, based upon our audits and the report of the other auditors, the financial statements 
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the respective financial position of the business-
type activities and the discretely presented component unit of The University of Alabama in Huntsville as 
of September 30, 2020 and 2019 and the respective changes in financial position and, where applicable, 



 

 
 

cash flows thereof for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted 
in the United States of America.    
 
Emphasis of Matter 
 
As discussed in Note 1, the financial statements of UAH are intended to present the financial position, 
the changes in financial position and the cash flows of only that portion of the business-type activities of 
the financial reporting entity of The University of Alabama System that is attributable to the transactions 
of UAH.  They do not purport to, and do not, present fairly the financial position of The University of 
Alabama System as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, the changes in its financial position, or its cash 
flows for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America.  Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter. 
 
Other Matters 
 
Required Supplementary Information 
 
The accompanying management’s discussion and analysis on pages 4 through 12 and the required 
supplementary information on pages 58 and 59 are required by accounting principles generally accepted 
in the United States of America to supplement the basic financial statements.  Such information, 
although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting 
Standards Board who considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic 
financial statements in the appropriate operational, economic, or historical context.  We have applied 
certain limited procedures to the required supplementary information in accordance with auditing 
standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which consisted of inquiries of 
management about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the information for 
consistency with management's responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, and other 
knowledge we obtained during our audits of the basic financial statements.  We do not express an 
opinion or provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us 
with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance. 
 
Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards 
 
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated January 21, 
2021 on our consideration of UAH’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its 
compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts and grant agreements and other 
matters for the year ended September 30, 2020.  The purpose of that report is to describe the scope of 
our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing and 
not to provide an opinion on internal control over financial reporting or on compliance.  That report is an 
integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering 
UAH’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN HUNTSVILLE 

The University of Alabama in Huntsville 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Unaudited) 

 

Introduction  
 
The University of Alabama in Huntsville is a public co-
educational, state-supported research university and is 
classified as a ‘high’ research institution by the 
Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, 
placing it among a select group of public universities in 
America. UAH has five research programs ranked in 
the top 25 in the nation, according to the National 
Science Foundation, including 5

th
 in the United States 

in aerospace engineering. UAH is 11
th
 in the nation in 

NASA-sponsored research and 28
th
 in the nation in 

DOD research. 
 
The University offers 88 degree-granting programs that 
meet the highest standards of excellence, including 41 
bachelor's degree programs, 31 master’s degree 
programs, and 16 doctoral programs through its nine 
colleges: Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences; 
Business; Education; Engineering; Graduate School; 
Honors; Nursing; Professional Studies; and Science.  
 
UAH is an autonomous campus within The University of 
Alabama System (the “System”) and is the anchor 
tenant for Cummings Research Park, the second 
largest university research park in the United States 
and home to approximately 300 high technology and 
research companies. 
 
UAH was listed as very competitive by Barron’s Profiles 
in American Colleges and was one of only two public 
universities in Alabama to earn this designation. U.S. 
News & World Report consistently ranks UAH among 
the magazine’s Tier 1 national universities, placing it 
among the top four percent of public universities in the 
nation. According to PayScale, UAH provides the 
number one return on investment of all Alabama 
schools for both in-state and out-of-state students. 
 

The University expended over $112 million for 
externally funded projects for the year ended 
September 30, 2020. Sponsors of research include 
federal and state agencies, academic institutions, 
industry and private foundations. Research is 
conducted within the nine individual colleges and 
through the University’s 17 independent research 
centers, laboratories and institutes.  
 
Major interdisciplinary research thrusts include: 
modeling and simulation; cybersecurity; systems 
engineering; rotorcraft and aerospace engineering; 

propulsion; optics; space physics and astrophysics; 
earth and atmospheric system science; information 
technology; materials science; biotechnology; 
nanotechnology; humanities; and lean supply chain, 
acquisition, and logistics. 
 
Federal economic relief funds represent funding 
received from the federal government as a result of the 
Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security 
(“CARES”) Act. The CARES Act was signed into law in 
March 2020 in order to provide economic assistance for 
businesses and individuals that have been negatively 
impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. During 2020, the 
University received grants primarily from two CARES 
Act programs, the Education Stabilization Fund 
Program Governor’s Emergency Relief Fund and the 
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act 
(CARES Act) Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund 
(HEERF)Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund.  
 
The Education Stabilization Fund Program Governor’s 
Emergency Relief Fund administered through the U.S. 
Department of Education awards grants to Governors 
for the purpose of providing local educational agencies, 
institutions of higher education, and other education 
related entities with emergency assistance as a result 
of the Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-
19).  Primarily designed to facilitate the distribution of 
emergency financial aid grants directly to students, as 
well as to provide funding for institutions negatively 
impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the terms 
of the student portion of this program, revenue is 
recognized once eligible expenditures associated with 
the distribution of aid to students have been incurred. 
For the institutional portions of this program, revenue is 
recognized as the University identifies eligible 
expenditures or lost revenues which qualify for 
reimbursement. Funds received are recognized into 
revenue as the University identifies eligible 
expenditures or lost revenues which qualify for 
reimbursement. Revenue awarded under the terms of 
this program totaled $5.67 million in 2020, and was 
primarily related to the distribution of emergency 
financial aid grants to students.  

The following discussion and analysis provides an overview of the financial performance and activities of The  
University of Alabama in Huntsville (the “University” or “UAH”) for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 
2019. This discussion and analysis has been prepared by University management along with the financial state-
ments and related note disclosures, and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related 
note disclosures. The financial statements, notes and this discussion are the responsibility of management.

Condensed Statements of Net Position

September 30

 
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security 
Act (CARES Act) Higher Education Emergency Relief 
Fund (HEERF)Higher Education Emergency Relief 
Fund is administered through the U.S. Department of 
Education and was for the funds to be used to prevent, 
prepare for, and respond to coronavirus only.  No other 
purpose is authorized.  Funds may not be utilized to 
replace or supplant any other funding nor to fill revenue 
shortfall gaps.  Revenue awarded from the Higher 
Education Emergency Relief Fund totaled $1.98 million 
and $1.3 million, respectively in 2020.  

 
Statements of Net Position 
 
The statements of net position present the assets, 
deferred outflows of resources, liabilities, deferred 
inflows of resources, and net position of the University 
as of the end of the fiscal years ended September 30, 
2020 and 2019. The purpose of the statements of net 
position is to present a fiscal snapshot of the University 
to the readers of the financial statements.  
 
The statements of net position present the assets 
available to continue the operations of the University. 

The statements also show how much the University 
owes vendors and lending institutions. Finally, the 
statements of net position provide a picture of the net 
position and the availability of resources for expenditure 
by the University. 
 
Net position is divided into three major categories. The 
first category, net investment in capital assets, provides 
the University’s equity in property, plant and equipment. 
The second asset category is restricted net position, 
which is further divided into two sub-categories, 
nonexpendable and expendable. The corpus of 
nonexpendable restricted resources, as it pertains to 
endowments, is only available for investment purposes, 
with the income earned thereon available primarily to 
fund scholarships and fellowships. Expendable 
restricted net position is available for expenditure by the 
University but must be spent for purposes as 
determined by donors and/or external entities that have 
placed a time or purpose restriction on the use of the 
assets. The final category is unrestricted net position, 
which is available to the University as needed.  
 
 

 
For the year ended September 30, 2020, the 
University’s current assets decreased $959 thousand 
primarily due to a decrease in operating investments. 
Endowment, life income and other investments 
decreased $447 thousand due to decreases in 
restricted cash and endowment investments. Capital 
assets, net of depreciation, decreased slightly by $611 
thousand. Other assets decreased $145 thousand. 

Current liabilities decreased $4.7 million. The majority 
of this decrease is due to a $3.6 million decrease in 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities, along with a 
$788 thousand decrease in unearned revenues due to 
lower enrollment. Noncurrent liabilities decreased by 
approximately $27.5 million, primarily the result of a 
decrease in the Pension and OPEB liability of $22.7 
million as required by GASB No. 68 and No. 75.

THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN HUNTSVILLE 

GASB Statements No. 68 and 75 require governmental 
employers participating in multi-employer cost-sharing 
pension and healthcare benefit plans to recognize 
liabilities for their proportionate share of the unfunded 
liability for plans whose actuarial liabilities exceed the 
plan’s net assets. As required by Alabama statute, all 
eligible employees of a qualifying public educational 
employer must be a member of the Teacher’s 
Retirement System of Alabama (TRS). As a qualifying 
employer, the University is required to make certain 
employer contributions on behalf of its employees 
participating in TRS’s defined benefit pension plan. 
Additionally, Alabama statutes permitted the University 
to opt-in to provide its eligible retirees with healthcare 
benefits through the Public Education Employees’ 
Health Insurance Plan (PEEHIP).  

The University recorded deferred outflows of resources 
of $667 thousand primarily due to differences between 
projected and actual earnings of the pension and OPEB 
plans. Deferred inflows of resources increased $21 
million due to the net differences between projected and 
actual earnings of the pension and OPEB plans.  

The employer contribution rates for both plans are 
established annually by TRS and PEEHIP, and adopted 
by the Alabama Legislature. Both the TRS employer 
contribution rate and the employer’s PEEHIP cost for 
retiree coverage are based upon the actuarial valuations 
performed by TRS and PEEHIP, respectively. Although 
the liabilities recognized under GASB 68 and 75 meet 
GASB’s definition of a liability within GASB’s framework 
for accounting standards, UAH does not believe that the 
associated recorded liabilities constitute legal liability for 
the University, nor do they open the University to other 
claims on its resources. See Note 9 and Note 10 to the 
financial statements for additional information. 

For the year ended September 30, 2019, the 
University’s current assets decreased $5 million 
primarily due to a decrease in operating investments. 
Endowment, life income and other investments 
increased $29.6 million due to increases in restricted 
cash and investments for capital activities. Capital 
assets, net of depreciation, increased $14.8 million 
primarily due to the completion of the Invention to 
Innovation Center. Other assets decreased $109 
thousand. Current liabilities increased $18.9 million. The 
majority of this increase is due to an $11.5 million 
increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, 
along with a $6.7 million increase in unearned revenues 
due to higher enrollment. Noncurrent liabilities increased 
by approximately $30.8 million, primarily the result of a 
$24.6 million increase to long-term debt related to debt 
issuance and an additional liability of $6.1 million for 
Pension and Other Post Employee Benefits (OPEB) as 
required by GASB No. 68 and No. 75. The University 
recorded deferred outflows of resources of $2.9 million 
primarily due to differences between projected and 
actual earnings of the pension and OPEB plans. 
Deferred inflows of resources decreased $1.4 million 

due to the net differences between projected and actual 
earnings of the pension and OPEB plans.  
 
For the year ended September 30, 2020, the 
University’s total net position increased $6.2 million. The 
University’s net investment in capital assets increased 
approximately $129 thousand. Restricted net position 
decreased approximately $1.1 million. Unrestricted net 
position increased approximately $7.2 million. Although 
unrestricted net assets are not subject to externally 
imposed stipulations, substantially all of the University's 
unrestricted net assets have been designed for capital 
projects, as well as various academic and research 
programs and initiatives.  
 
For the year ended September 30, 2019, the 
University’s total net position decreased $6.3 million. 
The University’s net investment in capital assets 
decreased approximately $3.1 million. Restricted net 
position decreased approximately $6.1 million. 
Unrestricted net position increased approximately $2.9 
million. Although unrestricted net assets are not subject 
to externally imposed stipulations, substantially  all of 
the University's unrestricted net assets have been 
designed for capital projects, as well as various 
academic and research programs and initiatives. 
 

Capital Assets 
 
For the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 
2018, the University had approximately $609.6 million, 
$592.1 million, and $561.1 million, invested in capital 
assets and accumulated depreciation of $298.7 million, 
$281.8 million, and $265.7 million, respectively. 
Depreciation charges for the years ended September 
30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, were $18.1 million, $17.2 
million, and $17.1 million, respectively. The following

Statements of Revenues, Expenses, and 

Changes in Net Position 
 
Changes in total net position as presented on the 
statements of net position are based on the activity 
presented in the statements of revenues, expenses, and 
changes in net position, which reflect the University’s 
results of operations. This presents the revenues and 
expenses, both operating and non-operating, along with 
other changes in net position.  
 
State appropriations are classified as non-operating, in 
accordance with GASB accounting standards, because 
they are provided by the State Legislature to the 
University without the Legislature directly receiving 
commensurate goods and services in return for those 
revenues. Without the non-operating revenues, in 
particular the state appropriations, the University would 
not be able to cover its costs of operations. These 
sources are critical to the University’s financial stability 
and directly impact the quality of its programs. A 
summarized comparison of the University’s revenues, 
expenses and changes in net position for the years 
ended September 30 is as follows:  

Major capital additions in 2020 included the Spragins Hall exterior renovation and Business Administration Building 
interior renovation. Major capital additions in 2019 included the completion of the Invention to Innovation Center. Ma-
jor capital additions for the year ended September 30, 2018 included completion of the Charger Village addition, a 
new sorority house, and construction of the Invention to Innovation Center.  

Additional information about the University’s capital assets is presented in Note 6 to the financial statements.

THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN HUNTSVILLE 

 

Approximately $55.3 million in state appropriations 
were received for the year ended September 30, 2020, 
an increase of 5.4% or $2.9 million from the prior year.  
 
Gross tuition and fees increased approximately $6.8 
million for the year ended September 30, 2020 due to 
a continued growth in total enrollment coupled with 
moderate tuition increases. Gross tuition and fees 
increased approximately $7.8 million for the year 
ended September 30, 2019 due to a continued growth 
in total enrollment.  
 
Significant recurring sources of the University’s 
revenues, such as state appropriations, are considered 
non-operating, as defined by GASB Statement No. 35, 
Basic Financial Statements-Management’s Discussion 
and Analysis – for Public Colleges and Universities. In 
fiscal year 2018, the University received an 
Intergovernmental transfer at the request of the 

University of Alabama System Office, for oversight and 
management of the University of Alabama System 
Regional Optical Network (UAS-RON) to all three 
campuses effective October 2017. It was determined 
that each campus would record 1/3 ownership in the 
UAS-RON Asset. The total asset amount is 
$1,192,646, and each campus will record $397,548 in 
assets.  
 
The following is a summary of revenues by source 
(both operating and non-operating) for the years ended  
September 30.

Investments produced losses for fiscal year 2020 in the 
amount of $1 million, a $1.2 million decrease over fiscal 
year 2019.  Investments produced income and gains for 
2019 in the amount of $187 thousand, a $4.7 million 
decrease over the prior year. Investments produced 
income and gains for the year ended September 30, 
2018 in the amount of $4.8 million, a $5.4 million 
decrease over fiscal year 2017. 
  
Grants and contracts revenues increased $17.2 million 
in 2020 due primarily to increases in federal, state, and 
private contracts of $16.2 million, $597 thousand, and 
$348 thousand, respectively.  For the year ended 
September 30, 2019 grants and contracts revenues 
increased $11.9 million due primarily to increases in 
federal and private contracts. For the year ended 
September 30, 2018, grants and contracts revenue 
increased $4.1 million due primarily to increases in 
federal contracts of $4.8 million. 
  
The University received gifts of approximately $2.2 
million for fiscal year 2020 and $2.8 million in 2019. 
This slight decrease was due to a reduction in corporate 
gifts to the University.  In 2018, gifts totaled $3.1 million, 
primarily from the University of Alabama Huntsville 
Foundation. 
  
The University’s auxiliary activities are comprised 
primarily of the Bevill Conference Center and Hotel, 
food service, housing, and bookstore.  Auxiliary 
activities increased $1.4 million, $3.1 million, and $781 
thousand for the years ended September 30, 2020, 
2019 and 2018, respectively.  
Sales and services revenue decreased by $1.7 million 
in 2020 due to a decrease in student activity on 

campus. For the year ended September 30, 2019, sales 
and services revenue stayed constant with a slight 
increase of $186 thousand. Sales and services revenue 
increased $1 million in 2018 due to increased student 
activity on campus. 
  
Grant revenue increased by $4.6 million in 2020 due to 
the University receiving emergency financial aid grants 
to students under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and 
Economic Security (CARES) Act. For the year ended 
September 30, 2020 the University received $3.7 million 
and $927 thousand from federal and state coronavirus 
relief funding, respectively.  
  
The University receives grant and contract revenue 
from federal, state and local governments and private 
agencies. These funds are used to further the mission 
of the University: research, education, and public 
service. These funds are recorded as operating 
revenues.

Economic Factors That Will Affect the 
Future 
 
Despite the global pandemic, The University of 
Alabama in Huntsville set its enrollment record for the 
sixth consecutive year. The University enrolled 10,000 
students in Fall 2020, a slight increase from 9,988 
students in Fall 2019. Tuition revenues accounted for 
approximately 55% of the unrestricted fund source. 
UAH is a leading destination for high-achieving 
students, with 52% of the first-time freshmen scoring 
4.0 or higher in high school grade point average. UAH 
is strategically investing its resources in student 
retention, and projects its future enrollment to hold 
steady or improve moderately.  
 
State appropriation accounted for 23% of the 
unrestricted fund source. Due to the ongoing support 
of higher education from the Alabama Legislature, 
UAH received a state appropriation increase of 4.2% 
in FY 2019, 6.6% in FY 2020, and 3.41% in FY 2021. 
The early projection from the state’s Educational Trust 

Fund (ETF) is promising despite the economic slow 
down caused by the pandemic.  
 
Facilities and Administrative Rates (F&A) accounted 
for another 7% of the University unrestricted fund 
source. UAH contracts and grants revenues increased 
approximately $16 million in FY 2020, which is a 17% 
increase from FY 2019. While the University does not 
anticipate the contracts and grants revenues to 
continue to grow at a double-digit pace, it does project 
the growth trend to continue next year. 
 
In summary, the primary source of revenues for the 
University’s unrestricted fund, tuition, state 
appropriation, and F&A is projected to remain stable 
or grow moderately in the near future.

Note 1 – Organization and Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies 
 
Financial Reporting Entity - The University of 
Alabama in Huntsville (the “University”) is one of three 
universities of The University of Alabama System (the 
“System”), a component unit of the State of Alabama. 
The financial statements of the University are intended 
to present the financial position, changes in financial 
position, and the cash flows of only that portion of the 
business type activities of the financial reporting entity 
of the System that is attributable to the transactions of 
the University. They do not purport to, and do not, 
present fairly the financial position of the System, its 
changes in financial position or cash flows in 
accordance with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America. The financial 
statements include individual schools, colleges and 
departments, and certain affiliated operations 
determined to be a part of the University’s financial 
reporting entity.  The System is recognized as an 
organization exempt from federal income tax under 
Section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code as an 
organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the 
Internal Revenue Code. 
 
Scope of Statements - The University follows 
Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) 
Statement No. 61, The Financial Reporting Entity: 
Omnibus-an amendment of GASB Statements No. 14 
and No. 34 (“GASB 61”). This Statement provides 
additional guidance in determining whether certain 
organizations affiliated with the University should be 
considered component units of the University for 
financial reporting purposes. The Statement also 
provides guidance on determining whether component 
units should be presented in the University’s financial 
statements as “blended” or “discrete” components 
based on their relationship and organizational structure. 
 
As defined by generally accepted accounting principles 
established by the GASB, the financial reporting entity 
consists of the University, as well as its discretely 
presented component unit, the University of Alabama 
Huntsville Foundation (“UAHF”). 
 
UAHF is a legally separate, tax-exempt component unit 
of the University. UAHF is organized exclusively for 
charitable, scientific, and educational purposes in order 
to benefit the University. UAHF is governed by a 37-
member board of trustees. Although the University 
does not control the timing or amount of receipts from 
UAHF, the majority of resources or income that UAHF 
holds and invests are restricted to the activities of the 

University by the donors. Because these restricted 
resources held by UAHF can only be used by, or for the 
benefit of, the University, UAHF is considered a 
component unit of the University. UAHF is reported in 
separate financial statements because it does not meet 
the criteria to be blended with the University as 
described in GASB 61. 
 
UAHF is a not-for-profit organization that reports its 
financial results under the Financial Accounting 
Standards Board (“FASB”) Statements. Most significant 
to UAHF’s operations and reporting model is 
Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 958, Not-for-
Profit Entities. As such, certain revenue recognition 
criteria and presentation features are different from 
GASB revenue recognition criteria and presentation 
features.  
 
While no modifications have been made to UAHF’s 
financial information in the University’s financial 
reporting entity for recognition or accounting 
differences, certain modifications have been made to 
the presentation of UAHF’s financial statements in the 
University’s financial reporting entity to conform with the 
University’s financial statement presentation. Significant 
note disclosures (see Note 2) to UAHF’s financial 
statements have been incorporated into the University’s 
notes to the financial statements. During fiscal years 
2020 and 2019, UAHF distributed $2,167,203 and 
$2,909,429, respectively, to or for the University for 
both restricted and unrestricted purposes. Complete 
financial statements for UAHF are available by phoning 
(256) 824-6350. 
 
The University is also affiliated with the Eminent 
Scholars Foundation, Alabama Engineering Foundation 
and UAH Alumni Association. These entities do not 
meet the definition of component units under GASB 
guidance. Therefore, they have not been included 
within the University’s financial statements.  
 
With Board approval on April 26, 2018, the University 
formed The University of Alabama in Huntsville 
Research and Technology Corporation (the “RTC”), an 
Alabama non-profit corporation. However, as of 
September 30, 2020 the RTC did not have any 
activities or balances to be included in UAH’s financial 
statements.

THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN HUNTSVILLE 

Basis of Accounting: For financial reporting 
purposes, the University is considered a special-
purpose government engaged only in business-type 
activities as defined by GASB Statement No. 35, Basic 
Financial Statements – and Management’s Discussion 
and Analysis – for Public Colleges and Universities, an 
amendment of GASB Statement No. 34, Basic 
Financial  Statements – and Management’s Discussion 
and Analysis – for State and Local Governments. 
Business-type activities are those that are financed in 
whole or in part by fees charged to external parties for 
goods or services. Revenues are recognized when 
earned, and expenses are recorded when an obligation 
has been incurred.  
 
Accordingly, the financial statements of the University 
have been prepared in accordance with accounting 
principles generally accepted in the United States of 
America, as prescribed by the Governmental 
Accounting Standards Board (“GASB”), using the 
economic measurement focus and the accrual basis of 
accounting. 
 
Net Position: Net position is classified into the 
following four categories according to external donor 
restrictions or availability of assets for satisfaction of 
University obligations: 
 

• Net investment in capital assets: Capital assets, 
net of accumulated depreciation and outstanding 
principal balances of debt attributable to the 
acquisition, construction, or improvement of those 
assets. 

 

• Restricted: 
 
Nonexpendable – Net position subject to 
externally imposed stipulations that they be 
maintained permanently by the University. 
Such assets include the corpus of the 
University’s permanent endowment funds.  
 
Expendable – Net position whose use by the 
University is subject to externally imposed 
stipulations that can be fulfilled by actions of 
the University pursuant to those stipulations or 
that expire by the passage of time. 
 

• Unrestricted: Net position that is not subject to 
externally imposed stipulations. Unrestricted net 
position may be designated for specific purposes 
by action of management or The Board of Trustees 
of the University of Alabama.  

 
Cash and Cash Equivalents: For purposes of the 
statement of cash flows, the University considers all 
highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 

three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash 
equivalents representing assets of the University’s 
endowment, life income, and other long-term 
investments are included in the noncurrent investments 
category. 
 
Investments: The University’s investment portfolio is 
primarily invested in investment pools maintained by 
The University of Alabama System. Fair value for the 
investment pools is determined by the System, based 
on the fair value of the underlying investment securities 
held by each investment pool. Fair value of the 
underlying securities held in each investment pool is 
based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes, where 
available, or determined using net asset values 
provided by underlying investment partnerships or 
companies. Fair value for investments held directly by 
the University is determined from quoted market prices 
or market prices of similar instruments. Net investment 
income or loss, including realized and unrealized gains 
and losses, is reported as non-operating revenues 
(expenses) in the statements of revenues, expenses 
and changes in net position. 
 
Investments are reported in three categories in the 
statement of net position. Investments recorded as 
endowment investments are those invested funds that 
cannot be used to fund current operations and thus are 
included in noncurrent assets. Investments for capital 
activities are included in noncurrent assets, except for 
amounts included in current assets to offset current 
construction-related payables. All other investments 
are included as operating investments. 
 
Accounts Receivable: Accounts receivable consist 
primarily of tuition and fees charged to students, and 
amounts due from the federal government, state and 
local governments, or private sources in connection 
with reimbursement of allowable expenditures made 
pursuant to the University’s grants and contracts. 
Accounts receivable are recorded net of estimated 
uncollectible amounts.  
 
Compensated Absences: The University accrues 
annual leave for employees at rates based upon length 
of service and job classification and compensatory time 
based upon job classification and years worked.

Capital Assets: Capital assets are recorded at cost at 
the date of acquisition, or acquisition value at date of 
donation in the case of gifts, less accumulated 
depreciation. For equipment, the University’s 
capitalization policy includes all items with a unit cost of 
$5,000 or more and an estimated useful life of greater 
than one year. Renovations to buildings, infrastructure, 
and land improvements that significantly increase the 
value or extend the useful life of the structure are 
capitalized. Routine repairs and maintenance are 
charged to operating expense in the year in which the 
expense was incurred. The University capitalizes 
certain software and development costs associated with 
obtaining and developing internal-use computer 
software. Implementation costs, which are capitalized, 
include consulting expenses and allocation of internal 
salaries and fringes for the core implementation team. 
Training costs are expensed as incurred. Prior to fiscal 
year 2018, interest costs for certain qualifying assets 
acquired with the proceeds of tax-exempt borrowings 
were capitalized and amortized over the life of the 
related asset. In 2018, the University early adopted 
GASB Statement No. 89, Accounting for Interest Cost 
Incurred before the end of a Construction Period. This 
statement simplifies accounting for interest cost 
incurred before the end of a construction period by 
requiring it to be expensed instead of capitalized.  
 
Depreciation of buildings and building improvements (5-
40 years), land improvements, and infrastructure (10 
years), library collection (10 years), computer software 
(10 years), and inventoried equipment (5-8 years) is 
computed on a straight-line basis. The University 
computes depreciation for certain buildings and building 
improvements using a componentized method. 
 
Collections are recognized as an asset on the 
accompanying statements of net position in accordance 
with GASB Statement No. 35. The University defines 
collections as works of art or similar assets that are held 
for public exhibition, education, or research in 
furtherance of public service rather than financial gain 
which are protected, kept unencumbered, cared for, 
and preserved. Collection items are recorded at cost as 
of the date of acquisition or at their appraised or 
acquisition value on the date of donation in the case of 
gifts. Gains or losses from the sale of collection items 
are reflected on the statement of revenues, expenses, 
and changes in net position.  
 
Unearned Revenues: Unearned revenues consist 
primarily of the portion of amounts received for fall 
semester student tuition and fees, and housing fees 
that are not earned until the next fiscal year. Unearned 
revenues also include amounts received from grant and 
contract sponsors that have not yet been earned.  
Revenues: The University’s policy for defining 
operating activities as reported on the statement of 
revenues, expenses, and changes in net position are 
those that generally result from transactions such as 

payments received for providing services, payments 
made for services or goods received, and from grants 
and contracts. Certain significant revenue streams 
relied upon to support operations are recorded as non-
operating revenues, as defined by GASB guidance, 
including state educational appropriations, private gifts 
for other than capital purposes, investment income, and 
Federal Pell Grants.  
 
Auxiliary enterprise revenues are generated primarily by 
University Housing. Capital gifts are considered neither 
operating nor non-operating activities, and are 
presented after non-operating activities on the 
accompanying statement of revenues, expenses, and 
changes in net position. 
 
Contract and Grant Revenue: The University receives 
contract and grant revenues from governmental and 
private sources. The University recognizes revenues 
associated with the sponsored programs in accordance 
with GASB Statement No. 33, Accounting and Financial 
Reporting for Nonexchange Transactions, based on the 
terms of the individual contract or grant. 
 
Scholarship Allowances and Student Aid: 
Scholarship allowances applied to student accounts are 
recorded as an offset to student tuition and fees and 
auxiliary revenue. Payments of financial aid made 
directly to students are classified as scholarship and 
fellowship expenses.  
 
Internal Sales Activities: All internal sales activities to 
the University departments from sales and service units 
(motor pool, postal services, telecommunications, etc.) 
have been eliminated in the accompanying financial 
statements.  
 
Federal Refundable Loans: Certain loans to students 
are administered by UAH with funding primarily 
supported by the federal government. UAH’s 
statements of net position include both the notes 
receivable and the related federal refundable loan 
liability representing federal capital contributions owed 
upon termination of the program.

THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN HUNTSVILLE 

 

Endowment Spending: For donor restricted 
endowments, the Uniform Prudent Management of 
Institutional Funds Act (UPMIFA), as adopted in 
Alabama, permits The Board of Trustees of the 
University of Alabama (the Board) to appropriate an 
amount of realized and unrealized endowment 
appreciation as the Board determines to be prudent. 
UPMIFA also prescribes the guidelines for the 
expenditure of donor-restricted endowment funds in the 
absence of overriding, explicit donor stipulations. 
UPMIFA focuses on the entirety of a donor-restricted 
endowment fund, that is, both the original gift amount(s) 
and net appreciation. UPMIFA includes a robust set of 
guidelines about what constitutes prudent spending, 
explicitly requiring consideration of the duration and 
preservation of the fund. The University’s policy is to 
retain the endowment realized and unrealized 
appreciation with the endowment after the spending 
rate distributions in a manner consistent with the 
standards of prudence prescribed by UPMIFA.  
 
Effective October 1, 2017, the Board adopted a 
spending rate of 4.5%, based on a moving five-year 
average of the market (unit) value, and return of gains 
for underwater endowments. The previous spending 
rate was 5% of the moving three-year average of the 
market (unit) value. 

 
Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial 
statements in conformity with accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America 
requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect amounts reported in the 
financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual 
results could differ from those estimates. 
 
Current Environment: The COVID-19 pandemic has 
negatively affected national, state, and local economies 
as well as global financial markets and the higher 
education landscape in general.  Commencing March 
15, 2020 course instruction at the University was 
conducted virtually and most students vacated the 
campus.  The University issued refunds of $3 million in 
fiscal year 2020 for parking, housing, and dining 
services not provided.  Students continued to meet their 
academic requirements for the remainder of the 2019-
20 academic year.  While the total financial impact on 
the University  cannot be quantified at this time, the 
pandemic may have a material adverse effect on the 
current and future financial profile and operating 
performance of the University.  The University continues 
to monitor the course of the pandemic and is prepared 
to take additional measures to protect the health of the 
University community and promote the continuity of its 
academic mission.    
 

Note 2 – Component Unit 
 
Basis of Accounting – The stand-alone financial 
statements of UAHF have been prepared on the accrual 
basis of accounting in accordance with accounting 
principles generally accepted in the United States of 
America as prescribed by the Financial Accounting 
Standards Board (“FASB”).  
 
Basis of Presentation – Net assets and revenues, 
expenses, gains and losses are classified based on the 
existence or absence of donor-imposed restrictions. Net 
assets of and changes therein are classified and 
reported as follows in separately issued financial 
statements:  
 
Without Donor Restrictions – Net assets that are not 
subject to donor-imposed restrictions. Items that affect 
this net asset category include unrestricted gifts and 
earnings on these unrestricted gifts. In order to comply 
with GASB presentation features, net assets without 
donor restrictions are presented as unrestricted net 
position within the University’s discrete presentation of 
this component unit. 

With Donor Restrictions – Net assets with donor 
restrictions are restricted by a donor for use for a 
particular purpose or in a particular future period. Some 
donor-imposed restrictions are temporary in nature and 
the restriction will expire when the resources are used in 
accordance with the donor's instructions, or when the 
stipulated time has passed. When a donor's restriction 
is met, or has expired, the amounts are reclassified to 
net assets without donor restrictions. Items that affect 
this net asset category include restricted gifts and 
earnings on endowment funds expendable for purposes 
stipulated by the donor. In order to comply with GASB 
presentation features, these net assets with donor 
restrictions for UAHF are presented as restricted 
expendable net position within the University’s discrete 
presentation of UAHF.  
 



FINANCIAL REPORT 2020                                                                                                                                                                   23

Some donor-imposed restrictions are to be maintained 
permanently by the Foundation. These resources 
include gifts wherein donors stipulate that the corpus be 
held in perpetuity (primarily gifts for endowment) and 
only the income earned on the gifts be made available 
for expenditure. In order to comply with GASB 
presentation features, net assets with these donor 
restrictions for UAHF are presented as restricted 
nonexpendable net position within the University’s 
discrete presentation of UAHF. 
 
Unrealized and realized gains and losses and dividends 
and interest from investing in income-producing assets 
may be included in any of these net asset classifications 
depending on donor restrictions or the absence thereof. 
 
In accordance with ASC 958-320, Not-for-Profit Entities, 

investments in debt securities and investments in equity 
securities with readily determinable fair values are 
reported at their fair values based on published market 
prices. Other investments, including real estate, are 
stated at cost or fair value at date of donation in the 
case of gifts. Changes in fair values are reported as 
unrealized gains or losses in the statement of activities. 
All interest income and realized gains and losses are 
reported in the statement of activities.  
 
Investments – The following are the cost and reported 
value of investments as of September 30, 2020 and 
2019: 

UAHF invests certain amounts in an investment pool 
(“Pooled Endowment Fund”) sponsored by The 
University of Alabama System. The value recognized for 
the investment pool is determined by the System and is 
based on UAHF’s proportionate share of the net asset 
value of the investment pool. The System has no 
variance power over the funds. Instead, the funds are 
distributed by the System to the Foundation upon its 
request. The investment pool invests in various 
investment securities, including both marketable and 
non-marketable securities.  
 
Investment in Unconsolidated Entities and Trust 
Receivable - UAHF is one of several beneficiaries of a 
trust established upon the death in 1974 of one of the 
University's benefactors. The sole assets of the trust 
consist of ownership interests in two closely-held 
Huntsville, Alabama businesses named Big Springs, 
Inc. ("Big Springs") and Chambers Bottling Company, 
LLC ("Chambers"). The trust holds a 70% interest in the 
common stock of Big Springs and a 65% interest in 
Chambers.  
The trust was established with both lead and remainder 

beneficiaries. The lead interest in the trust (that is, the 
rights to the income generated by the trust assets) is 
divided equally among three sets of beneficiaries who 
hold a lifetime interest in those rights. As each lead 
interest terminates, a proportionate amount of the 
underlying assets in the trust is distributed among two 
residual beneficiaries, UAHF and another unrelated 
charitable organization. UAHF's share of the residual 
interest of the trust assets is 90%. UAHF accounts for 
its residual interest in the trust as an unconditional 
promise to give noncash assets, consistent with 
generally accepted accounting principles for situations 
where a donee has the eventual right to noncash assets 
held by a charitable trust but not the cash flows 
generated by them while they are held by the trust. 
UAHF recorded this interest at fair value as of the date it 
was awarded in 1974, and currently carries this interest 
in the Trust receivable line on UAHF's accompanying 
statements of financial position.

THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN HUNTSVILLE 

During 2008, one of the income interests terminated, 
and a pro-rata distribution of the ownership interests 
held by the trust was transferred to UAHF. As a result of 
the satisfaction of a pro-rata share of the pledge, UAHF 
recognized a gain of $4,375,835 representing the 
increase in fair value of the noncash assets between 
the date the assets were promised in 1974 and their 
values upon actual receipt in 2008. As a result of the 
receipt of these equity interests, UAHF currently holds 
approximately 21% and 19.5% of Big Springs and 
Chambers, respectively. These equity interests allow 
UAHF to exercise significant influence over Big Springs 
and Chambers, and accordingly, UAHF accounts for 
these interests using the equity method of accounting.  
 
During the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, 
UAHF recorded its proportionate share of earnings of 
each company (on a combined basis) of $1,200,476 
and $708,048 respectively. In addition, UAHF received 
distributions from Chambers of $1,005,944 and 
$627,159 in FY 2020 and FY 2019, respectively. Big 
Springs did not make any distributions in either FY 2020 
or FY2019.  
 
Eventually, all of the assets in the trust will be 
distributed upon the termination of the remaining lead 
interests, and the trust will terminate. At such time, 
UAHF will hold controlling interests of 63% and 58.5% 
in Big Springs and Chambers, respectively, and will 
consolidate these entities. UAHF will account for these 
interests under the equity method until the last lead 
interest is terminated, including the period after the 
termination of the second lead interest.  
 
This table summarizes the combined financial position 
and results of operations of Big Springs and Chambers 
(on a consolidated basis) for the years ended 
September 30, 2020 and 2019. 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Income Taxes - The Foundation is a nonprofit 
corporation that is exempt from federal income taxes 
under Section 501 (c)(3) of the Internal Revenue code 
for activities related to its exempt purpose. Certain of 

the Foundation’s activities are considered by the 
Internal Revenue Service to provide unrelated business 
income and, accordingly, income from these activities is 
subject to federal income tax. The Foundation’s income 
tax expense totaled $235,398 and $121,200 for the 
years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, 
respectively.   
 
Endowments - The Alabama Uniform Prudent 
Management of Institutional Funds Act (UPMIFA) was 
enacted by the State Legislature and signed into law 
effective January 1, 2009. UPMIFA prescribes new 
guidelines for the expenditure of a donor-restricted 
endowment funds in the absence of overriding, explicit 
donor stipulations. Its predecessor, UMIFA, focused on 
the prudent spending of the net appreciation of the 
fund. UPMIFA instead focuses on the entirety of a 
donor-restricted endowment fund, that is, both the 
original gift amount and net appreciation. UPMIFA 
eliminates UMIFA's historic-dollar-value threshold, an 
amount below which an organization could not spend 
from the fund, in favor of a more robust set of 
guidelines about what constitutes prudent spending, 
explicitly requiring consideration of the duration and 
preservation of the fund. UAHF follows guidance 
provided by the FASB relevant to endowments of not-
for-profit organizations and the related net asset 
classification of endowment funds subject to an 
enacted version of UPMIFA and enhanced disclosures 
for all endowment funds. The earnings distributions are 
appropriated for expenditure by the governing Board of 
Trustees of UAHF in a manner consistent with the 
standard of prudence prescribed by UPMIFA. In order 
to conform to the standards for prudent fiduciary 
management of investments, UAHF’s Board of 
Trustees has adopted endowment investment and 
spending policies that attempt to provide a predictable 
stream of funding to programs supported by its 
endowment while seeking to maintain the purchasing 
power of endowment assets.

Note 3 – Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 

The Board approves, by resolution, all banks or other 
financial institutions utilized as depositories for 
University funds. Prior to approval, each proposed 
depository must provide evidence of its designation by 
the Alabama State Treasurer as a qualified public 
depository under the Security of Alabama Funds 
Enhancement Act (SAFE). From time to time, the 
Board may request that the depository provide 
evidence of its continuing designation as a qualified 
public depository. Under the mandatory SAFE 
program, each qualified public depository (QPD) is 
required to hold collateral for all its public depositories 
on a pooled basis in a custody account established for 
the State Treasurer as SAFE administrator. In the 
unlikely event a public entity should suffer a deposit 
loss due to QPD insolvency or default, a claim form 
would be filed with the State Treasurer who would use 
the SAFE pool collateral or other means to reimburse 
the loss.   
 
As of September 30, 2020 and 2019, the University 
had cash and cash equivalents totaling $51,183,326 
and $48,717,630 respectively. Included in the amounts 
are deposits with trustees held for reserves, which 
totaled $8,593,145 and $19,153,493 in fiscal years 
2020 and 2019, respectively.  
 

Note 4 – Investments 
 
The University invests its endowment funds in 
accordance with applicable limitations set forth in gift 
instruments, Board guidelines, or applicable laws. Also 
certain bond indentures require the University to invest 
the amounts held in specific construction funds, 
redemption funds, and bond funds in federal securities, 
eligible certificates, or eligible investments. 
 
The Board has the responsibility for the establishment 
of the investment policy and the oversight of the 
investments for the System and related entities. In 
order to facilitate System-wide investment objectives 
and achieve economies of scale, the Board previously 
established three distinct investment pools based 
primarily on the projected investment time-horizons for 
System funds: the Pooled Endowment Fund (“PEF”), 
the Long Term Reserve Pool Fund  (“LTRP”), and the 
Short Term Liquidity Pool Fund (“STLP”); collectively, 
the “System Pools.” In April 2020, the Board approved 
a merger of the STLP and the LTRP into one pool, the 
Liquidity and Capital Reserve Pool (“LCRP”). In July 
2020, the Board closed the STLP and transferred the 
assets to the LTRP to create the new merged pool, 
with a new asset allocation. Pursuant to Board 
investment policies, each System or related entity may 
include all or a portion of their investments within the 
System-sponsored investment pools. These 

investment funds are considered “internal” investment 
pools under GASB Statement No. 31, Accounting and 
Financial Reporting for Certain Investments and for 
External Investment Pools, with the assets pooled on a 
market value basis. Separately managed funds that 
reside with each entity are to be invested consistent 
with the asset mix of the corresponding System 
investment pool. The following disclosures relate to 
both the System Pools, which include the investments 
of other System entities and other affiliated entities, 
and the University-specific investment portfolio. 
 
Pooled Endowment Fund (PEF): The purpose of the 
PEF is to pool endowment and similar funds to support 
the System universities, hospital and related entities in 
carrying out their respective missions over a perpetual 
time frame. Accordingly, the primary investment 
objectives of the PEF are to preserve the purchasing 
power of the principal and provide a stable source of 
perpetual financial support to the endowment 
beneficiaries. To satisfy the long-term rate of return 
objective, the PEF relies on a total return strategy in 
which investment returns are achieved through both 
capital appreciation and natural income. Asset 
allocation targets are established to meet the return 
objectives, while providing adequate diversification in 
order to minimize investment volatility. 
 
Long Term Reserve Pool Fund (effective July 1, 
2020, merged with STLP to form the LCRP): The 
LTRP was a longer-term pool used as an investment 
vehicle to manage operating reserves with a time 
horizon of three to seven years. This fund had an 
investment objective of growth and income and was 
invested in a diversified asset mix of liquid, semi-liquid, 
and illiquid securities. This fund can invest no more 
than 10% in illiquid assets. 
 
Short Term Liquidity Pool Fund (effective July 1, 
2020, merged with the LTRP to form the LCRP): 
The STLP served as an investment vehicle to manage 
operating reserves with a time horizon of one to three 
years. This fund was also used to balance the other 
funds when looking at the System’s entire asset 
allocation of operating reserves relative to its 
investment objectives. The STLP had an investment 
objective of income with preservation of capital and 
was invested in intermediate-term fixed income 
securities. The fund held at least one large mutual fund 
to provide daily liquidity.

THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN HUNTSVILLE 

Liquidity and Capital Reserve Pool: The LCRP 
serves as an investment vehicle to manage operating 
reserves of the System universities, hospital, and 
related entities with an investment strategy that 
matches the duration of reserves to their projected 
needs.  The goals of the pool are to preserve and grow 
capital, maximize returns without undue exposure to 
risk, and maintain sufficient liquidity for credit ratings.  
The pool is invested in a diversified asset mix of liquid, 
semi-liquid, and illiquid securities.  The pool can invest 
no more than 15% in illiquid assets and must invest no 
less than 60% in liquid assets as defined by Board 
Rule 404.  
 
Fair Value Measurements: GASB 72 sets forth the 
framework for measuring fair value. That framework 
provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the 
inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair 
value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to 
unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for 
identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) 
and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 
measurements). The three levels of the fair value 
hierarchy under GASB 72 are described as follows: 
 

• Level 1 – Inputs to the valuation methodology are 
unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or 
liabilities in active markets that the University has 
the ability to access.  

 

• Level 2 – Inputs to the valuation methodology 
include: 

 

• Quoted prices for similar assets or 
liabilities in active markets; 

• Quoted prices for identical or similar 
assets or liabilities in inactive markets; 

• Inputs other than quoted prices that are 
observable for the assets or liabilities;  

• Inputs that are derived principally from or 
corroborated by observable market data 
by correlation or other means. 

 

• Level 3 – Inputs to the valuation methodology are 
unobservable and significant to the fair value 
measurement. Unobservable inputs reflect the 
University’s own assumptions about the inputs 
market participants would use in pricing the asset 
or liability (including assumptions about risk). 
Unobservable inputs are developed based on the 
best information available in the circumstances 
and may include the University’s own data.  

 

 
GASB 72 allows for the use of net asset value (“NAV”) 
as a practical expedient for valuation purposes. 
Investments that use NAV in determining fair value are 

disclosed separately from the valuation hierarchy as 
presented herein. 
 
The level within the hierarchy is based on the lowest 
level of input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement. Valuation techniques used need to 
maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize 
the use of unobservable inputs.  
 
The determination of what constitutes observable 
requires judgment by the University’s management. 
University management considers observable data to 
be that market data which is readily available, regularly 
distributed or updated, reliable, and verifiable, not 
proprietary, and provided by multiple independent 
sources that are actively involved in the relevant 
market. The categorization of an investment within the 
hierarchy is based upon the relative observability of 
the inputs to its fair value measurement and does not 
necessarily correspond to University management’s 
perceived risk of that investment. 
 
The following is a description of the valuation methods 
and assumptions used by the University to estimate 
the fair value of its investments. There have been no 
changes in the methods and assumptions used at 
September 30, 2020. The methods described may 
produce a fair value calculation that may not be 
indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future 
fair values. University management believes its 
valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with 
other market participants. The use of different 
methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair 
value of certain financial instruments could result in a 
different fair value measurement at the reporting date. 
 
When available, quoted prices are used to determine 
fair value. When quoted prices in active markets are 
available, investments are classified within Level 1 of 
the fair value hierarchy. The University’s Level 1 
investments primarily consist of investments in mutual 
funds, exchange traded funds, and both domestic and 
foreign equity funds. When quoted prices in active 
markets are not available, fair values are based on 
evaluated prices received from the University’s 
custodian of investments.

Investment Risk Factors: Many factors can affect the 
value of investments. Some, such as custodial credit 
risk, concentration of credit risk and foreign currency 
risk, may affect both equity and fixed income securities. 
 
Equity securities respond to such factors as economic 
conditions, individual company earnings performance 
and market liquidity, while fixed income securities are 
particularly sensitive to credit risks and changes in 
interest rates.  
 
Credit Risk: Fixed income securities are subject to 
credit risk, which is the chance that a bond issuer will 
fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner, or that 
negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make 
these payments will cause security prices to decline. 
These circumstances may arise due to a variety of 
factors such as financial weakness, bankruptcy, 
litigation, and/or adverse political developments. Certain 
fixed income securities, primarily obligations of the U.S. 
government or those explicitly guaranteed by the U.S. 
government, are not considered to have significant 
credit risk.  
 
The investment policy recognizes that credit risk is 
appropriate in balanced investment pools such as the 
PEF and LCRP, and the credit quality of underlying fund 
investments is monitored on an ongoing basis.  Fixed 
income investments within the PEF and LCRP include 
corporate, mortgage backed, asset backed, 

collateralized mortgage and U.S. treasury and/or 
agency bonds. In addition, approximately $202.6 million 
and $39.4 million in the PEF and LTRP (2019)/LCRP 
(2020), collectively, at September 30, 2020 and 2019, 
respectively, is invested in unrated fixed income 
securities, excluding fixed income commingled funds. 
Fixed income commingled funds and money market 
funds were approximately $509.2 million and $299.5 
million in the PEF and LTRP (2019)/LCRP (2020), 
collectively, at September 30, 2020 and 2019, 
respectively. 
 
The STLP fixed income investments included corporate, 
mortgage backed, asset backed, collateralized 
mortgage and U.S. treasury and/or agency bonds. As of 
September 30, 2019, approximately $173.2 million was 
invested by the STLP in unrated fixed income securities; 
excluding commingled bond funds and money market 
funds. Fixed income commingled funds and money 
market funds totaled approximately $263.1 million at 
September 30, 2019. 
 
The credit risk for fixed and variable income securities, 
for the System Pools, at September 30, 2020 and 2019 
are as follows: 



36                                                                                                                                                                    FINANCIAL REPORT 2020

Custodial Credit Risk: Custodial credit risk is the 
risk that in the event of a corporate failure of a 
custodian, the System’s investment securities may 
not be returned. Investment securities in the System 
Pools are registered in the Board’s name by the 
custodial bank as an agent for the System. Other 
types of investments (i.e. open-ended mutual funds, 
money market funds) represent ownership interests 
that do not exist in physical or book-entry form. As a 
result, custodial credit risk is remote. 
 
Concentration of Credit Risk: Concentration of 
credit risk is the risk associated with a lack of 
diversification, such as having substantial 
investments in a few individual issuers, thereby 
exposing the organization to greater risks resulting 
from adverse economic, political, regulatory, 
geographic, or credit developments. As previously 
mentioned, credit risk in each investment pool is 
managed primarily by diversifying across issuers and 
limiting the amount of portfolio assets that can be 
invested in non-investment grade securities. As of 
September 30, 2020 and 2019, there was no 
investment in a single issuer that represents 5% or 
more of total investments held by any single 
investment manager of the System Pools, except for 
investments issued by the U.S. government and 
money market fund investments.  
Interest Rate Risk: Interest rate risk is the risk that 

the value of fixed income securities will decline 
because of changing interest rates. The prices of 
fixed income securities with a longer time to maturity, 
measured by effective duration, tend to be more 
sensitive to changes in interest rates and, therefore, 
more volatile than those with shorter durations. 
Effective duration is the approximate change in price 
of a security resulting from a 100 basis point (1 
percentage point) change in the level of interest 
rates. It is not a measure of time. The Board does not 
have a specific policy relative to interest rate risk. As 
such, there are no restrictions on weighted average 
maturity for each investment pool as they are 
managed relative to the investment objectives and 
liquidity demands of the investors.  
 
The effective durations for fixed or variable income 
securities held by the System Pools at September 30, 
2020 and 2019 are as follows:

The information presented does not take into account 
the relative weighting of the portfolio components to 
the total portfolio. 
 
Investments may also include mortgage backed 
securities and collateralized mortgage obligations that 
may be considered to be highly sensitive to changes 
in interest rates due to the existence of prepayment or 
conversion features. As of September 30, 2020 and 

2019, the fair market value of these investments held 
by the System Pools are as follows: 

Mortgage Backed Securities: These securities are 
issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association 
(Fannie Mae), Government National Mortgage 
Association (Ginnie Mae) and Federal Home Loan 
Mortgage Association (Freddie Mac) and include short 
embedded prepayment options. Unanticipated 
prepayments by the obligees of the underlying assets 
reduce the total expected rate of return. 
 
Collateralized Mortgage Obligations: Collateralized 
mortgage obligations (CMOs) generate a return based 
upon either the payment of interest or principal on 
mortgages in an underlying pool. The relationship 
between interest rates and prepayments makes the 
fair value highly sensitive to changes in interest rates. 

In falling interest rate environments, the underlying 
mortgages are subject to a higher propensity of 
prepayments. In a rising interest rate environment, the 
opposite is true.  
 
As of September 30, 2020 and 2019, the effective 
durations for these securities are as follows:

Foreign Currency Risk: The strategic asset 
allocation policy for the PEF and the LCRP includes 
an allocation to non-United States equity securities 
and fixed income securities. Currency hedging of 
foreign bonds and stocks is allowed under System 
Policy. As of September 30, 2020 and 2019, all 
foreign investments in the System Pools are 
denominated in U.S. dollars and are in international 
commingled funds, which in turn invest in equity 
securities and bonds of foreign issuers except for 
foreign stock and non-U.S. bond funds denominated 
in U.S. dollars and held by each of the three pools as 
disclosed in the previous tables. At September 30, 
2020 and 2019,  the University did not hold any 
foreign securities in its separately held investment 
portfolio. 
 
Securities Lending: The System permits security 
lending as a mechanism to augment income. Loans of 
the securities are required to be collateralized by 
cash, letters of credit or securities issued or 
guaranteed by the U.S. Government or its agencies. 
The collateral must equal at least 102% of the current 
market value of the loaned securities. Securities 
lending contracts must state acceptable collateral for 
securities loaned, duties of the borrower, delivery of 
loaned securities and acceptable investment of the 
collateral. 
 
At September 30, 2020 and 2019, there were no 
securities on loan from the investment pools.  

Note 5 – Receivables 
 

Pledges: The University receives pledges and 
bequests of financial support. Revenue is recognized 
when a pledge representing an unconditional promise 
to give is received and all eligibility requirements, 
including time requirements, have been met. In the 
absence of such a promise, revenue is recognized 
when the gift is received. Pledges are recorded at 
their gross, undiscounted amount, net of a reasonable 
allowance for doubtful accounts. Endowment pledges 
do not meet eligibility requirements and are not 
recorded as assets until the related gift is received. 
Due to uncertainties with regard to their realization 
and valuation, bequest intentions and other 
conditional promises are not recognized as assets 
until the specified conditions are met. The University’s 
trust policies do not differ in nature from endowment 
policies.  
 
The composition of accounts receivable as of 
September 30, 2020 and 2019 is summarized as 
follows: 

2020 2019

Tuition and fees 14,906,747$      13,572,818$

The following is a detailed schedule of long-term debt: 

The University’s general fee bonds and student 
housing bonds are subject to certain covenants. These 
covenants, among other things, require the University 
to establish and maintain reasonable fees, rates, and 
other charges to ensure pledged revenues are 
sufficient for debt service coverage; to maintain books 
and records pertaining to the pledged revenues; to 
furnish annual audits and other periodic reports that 
reflect the financial condition of the University, the 
project, other pledged facilities, and other pledged 
assets; and to comply with certain restrictions as to 
additional indebtedness. The University is in 
compliance with all restrictive financial covenants as of 
September 30, 2020. 
 
During the year, the University refinanced the General 
Fee Revenue Bonds Series 2009A and Student 
Housing Revenue Bonds Series 2010A, which resulted 
in a reduction of future principal and interest payments 
of $596 thousand. This will average $25.9 thousand 
per year for the next 23 years. The amounts 
outstanding on these bonds were paid in October 2019 
in the amount of $29.87 million. There is no defeased 
debt related to the General Fee Revenue Bond Series 
2009A and Student Housing Revenue Bond Series 

2010A. The University leveraged the annual cash flow 
savings which resulted in a project fund deposit of $4.4 
million to be used on deferred building maintenance.

THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN HUNTSVILLE 

Note 8 – Self-Insurance 
 
The University participates with other campuses in the 
System in a self-insurance program for general liability 
risks. The Board established a separate revocable trust 
fund for payment of these self-insurance claims under 
its risk retention program. Annual contributions are 
made to the consolidated trust fund, at an actuarially 
determined rate, to provide funding for the retained risk. 
The accompanying statements of net position include a 
reserve of $485,640 and $457,038 for general liability 
for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively.  
 
The University also maintains a self-insured health 
plan. During 2020, the University paid $26.00 and 
$18.16 per month per health insurance contract for 
administrative charges and stop loss coverage, 
respectively. The accompanying statements of net 
position include a self-insurance reserve of $1,636,889 
and $1,614,124 for health insurance for 2020 and 
2019, respectively. Annual contributions are made to 
the health plan, utilizing an actuarially determined rate, 
to provide funding for the reserve. The changes in the 
total reported self-insurance liabilities are summarized 
as follows: 
 

Note 9 – Employee Benefits  
 

Eligible employees of the University participate in the 
mandatory Teachers’ Retirement System of Alabama 
(“TRS”), a cost sharing, multiple-employer public 
retirement system designated as a defined benefit plan. 
In addition, eligible employees may elect to participate 
in a voluntary UA System 403(b) defined contribution 
retirement plan. Prior to fiscal year 2020, the plan 
offered eligible employees a choice between two 
recordkeepers, Teachers Insurance and Annuity 
Association (“TIAA”) and the Variable Annuity Life 
Insurance Company (“VALIC”). Effective in fiscal year 
2020, the System, in conjunction with its participating

Defined Benefit Plan – TRS 
Plan description. The Teacher’s Retirement System of 
Alabama, a cost-sharing multiple-employer public 
employee retirement plan, was established as of 
September 15, 1939, under the provisions of Act 419 of 
the Legislature of 1939 for the purpose of providing 

retirement allowances and other specified benefits for 
qualified persons employed by State-supported 
educational institutions. The responsibility for the 
general administration and operation of the TRS is 
vested in its Board of Control. The TRS Board of 
control consists of 15 trustees. The plan is administered 
by the Retirement Systems of Alabama (“RSA”). Title 
16-Chapter 25 of the Code of Alabama grants the 
authority to establish and amend the benefit terms to 
the TRS Board of Control. The Plan issues a publicly 
available financial report that can be obtained at 
www.rsa-al.gov.  
 
Benefits provided. State law establishes retirement 
benefits as well as death and disability benefits and any 
ad hoc increase in postretirement benefits for the TRS. 
Members of the TRS are classified as either Tier 1 or 
Tier 2 plan members, contingent upon if their eligible 
service began prior to January 1, 2013. Benefits for 
TRS members vest after 10 years of creditable service. 
Tier 1 members who retire after age 60 with 10 years or 
more of creditable service or with 25 years of service 
(regardless of age) are entitled to an annual retirement 
benefit, payable monthly for life unless there is a return 
to full-time employment with a TRS or Employees’ 
Retirement System (“ERS”) agency, or to temporary 
employment in excess of specified limits. Service and 
disability retirement benefits are based on a 
guaranteed minimum or a formula method, with the 
member receiving payment under the method that 
yields the highest monthly benefit. Under the formula 
method, Tier 1 members of the TRS are allowed 
2.0125% of their average final compensation (highest 3 
of last 10 years) for each year of service. 
 
Act 377 of the Legislature of 2012 established a new 
tier of benefits (Tier 2) for members hired on or after 
January 1, 2013. Tier 2 members are eligible for 
retirement after age 62 with 10 years or more of 
creditable service and are entitled to an annual 
retirement benefit, payable monthly for life unless there 
is a return to full-time employment with a TRS or ERS 
agency, or to temporary employment in excess of 
specified limits. Service and disability retirement 
benefits are based on a guaranteed minimum or a 
formula method, with the member receiving payment 
under the method that yields the highest monthly 
benefit. Under the formula method, Tier 2 members of 
the TRS are allowed 1.65% of their average final 
compensation (highest 5 of the last 10 years) for each 
year of service. Members are eligible for disability 
retirement if they have 10 years of creditable service, 
are currently in-service, and determined by the RSA 
Medical Board to be permanently incapacitated from 
further performance of duty.

Preretirement death benefits are calculated and paid 
to the beneficiary based on the member’s age, service 
credit, employment status and eligibility for retirement. 
 
Contributions. Covered members of the TRS 
contributed 5% of earnable compensation to the TRS 
as required by statute until September 30, 2011. From 
October 1, 2011, to September 30, 2012, covered 
members of the TRS were required by statute to 
contribute 7.25% of earnable compensation. Effective 
October 1, 2012, covered members of the TRS are 
required by statute to contribute 7.5% of earnable 
compensation. Tier 2 covered members of the TRS 
contribute 6% of earnable compensation to the TRS 
as required by statute. All regular employees of the 
University are members of the TRS with the exception 
of temporary employees. 
 
The University’s contractually required contribution 

rate for the year ended September 30, 2020 was 
12.43% of annual pay for Tier 1 members and 11.34% 
of annual pay for Tier 2 members. The University’s 
contribution rate for the year ended September 30, 
2019 was 12.41% of annual pay for Tier 1 members 
and 11.35% of annual pay for Tier 2 members.  
 
These required contribution rates are a percent of 
annual payroll, actuarially determined as an amount 
that, when combined with member contributions, is 
expected to finance the costs of benefits earned by 
members during the year, with an additional amount 
to finance any unfunded accrued liability. The 
following is a comparative presentation of 
contributions: 

Salaries and wages for covered employees 
participating in TRS were approximately $112.1 
million during the year ended September 20, 2020 
and $105.4 million during 2019.  
 
Pension Liabilities, Pension Expense, and Deferred 
Outflows of Resources and Deferred Inflows of 
Resources Related to Pensions. At September 30, 
2020 and 2019, the financial statements of the 
University reflected a liability of $161,346,000 and 
$150,951,000 for its proportionate share of the 
collective net pension liability, as prescribed by GASB 
68. For the 2020 reported amounts the collective net 
pension liability was measured as of September 30, 
2019 and the total pension liability used to calculate 
the net pension liability was determined by an 
actuarial valuation as of September 30, 2018. 

The University’s proportion of the collective net 
pension liability was based on the employers’ shares 
of contributions to the pension plan relative to the total 
employer contributions of all participating TRS 
employers. At September 30, 2019 the University’s 
proportion was 1.46% which was a decrease of 0.06% 
from its proportion measured as of September 30, 
2018.

Actuarial assumptions. The total pension liability was 
determined by an actuarial valuation as of September 
30, 2018 using the following actuarial assumptions, 
applied to all periods included in the measurement: 
 
 

 

The actuarial assumptions used in the September 30, 
2018 valuation were based on the results of an  
actuarial experience study for the period October 1, 
2010—September 30, 2015. Post-Retirement 
mortality rates for service retirements and dependent 
beneficiaries were based on the RP-2000 White Collar 
Mortality Table projected to 2020 using scale BB and 
adjusted 115% for all ages for males and 112% for 
ages 78 and over for females. The rates of disabled 
mortality were based on the RP-2000 Disability 
Mortality Table projected to 2020 using scale BB and 
adjusted 105% for males and 120% for females. 
 
The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan 

investments was determined using a log-normal 
distribution analysis in which best-estimate ranges of 
expected future real rates of return (expected returns, 
net of pension plan investment expense and inflation) 
are developed for each major asset class. These 
ranges are combined to produce the long-term 
expected rate of return by weighting the expected 
future real rates of return by the target asset allocation 
percentage and by adding expected inflation. The 
target asset allocation and best estimates of 
geometric real rates of return for each major asset 
class are as follows: 

Year ending September 30:

2021 ($1,410,000)

2022 ($783,000)

2023 $2,313,000

Discount rate. The discount rate used to measure the 
total pension liability was 7.70%. The projection of 
cash flows used to determine the discount rate 
assumed that plan member contributions will be made 
at the current contribution rate and that the employer 
contributions will be made at rates equal to the 
difference between actuarially determined contribution 
rates and the member rate. Based on those 
assumptions, components of the pension plan’s 
fiduciary net position were projected to be available to 
make all projected future benefit payments of current 
plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate 
of return on pension plan investments was applied to 
all periods of projected benefit payments to determine 
the total pension liability.  
Sensitivity of the University’s proportionate share of 

the net pension liability to changes in the discount rate. 
The following table reflects the University’s 
proportionate share of the net pension liability, as 
prescribed by GASB 68, and is calculated using the 
discount rate of 7.70%, as well as what the University’s 
proportionate share of the net pension liability would 
be if it were calculated using a discount rate that is 1-
percentage point lower (6.70%) or 1-percentage-point 
higher (8.70%) than the current rate: 

Pension plan fiduciary net position. Detailed 
information about the pension plan’s fiduciary net 
position is available in the separately issued RSA

Defined Contribution Plans 
 
As previously noted, some employees participate in a 
voluntary UA System 403(b) defined contribution plan. 
In defined contribution plans, benefits depend solely 
on amounts contributed plus investment earnings. All 
employees, except those enrolled as students and 
regularly attending classes offered by a System 
university, are eligible to participate from the date of 
employment. Employer matching contributions are 
made for match-eligible participants by the System 
Office at a rate of 100% of elective deferrals up to a 
discretionary percentage of compensation per pay 

period, currently 5%. The University’s contribution is 
funded as it accrues and, along with that of 
employees, is immediately and fully vested. In FY 
2020, employer matching contributions in the voluntary 
UA System 403(b) plan (inclusive of The University of 
Alabama, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, 
The University of Alabama in Huntsville, and the UA 
System Office), and the UAB Hospital Management, 
LLC 403(b) plan were temporarily suspended for the 
period of May 2020 through September 2020. The 
suspension was due to uncertainty concerning the 
potential financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic 
and was a joint management decision by Senior 
Administration of the UA System and each University. 
The contribution for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, 
excluding amounts not eligible for matching, are

The University’s total salaries and wages subject to benefit plan participation for the years ended September 30, 
2020 and 2019 are summarized in the table below: 

Compensated Absences 
 
Certain University employees accrue vacation and 
sick leave at varying rates depending upon their 
years of continuous service and payroll 
classification, subject to maximum limitations. Upon 
termination of employment, employees are paid all 
unused accrued vacation at their regular rate of pay 
up to a designated maximum number of days. The 
statement of net position includes vacation pay and 
salary-related payments associated with vacation 
pay accruals of $5,255,179 and $4,829,058 for fiscal 
years  2020 and 2019, respectively. There is no 
such accrual recognized for sick leave benefits 
because no terminal cash benefit is available to 
employees for accumulated sick leave.  
 

Note 10 – Post-Employment Benefits 
 
Post-employment health care benefits are offered to 
all employees who officially retire from the University 
through the Alabama Retired Education Employees’ 
Health Care Trust with TRS. TRS offers health care 
benefits through a cost-sharing multiple-employer 
defined benefit health care plan administered by the 
Public Education Employee Health Insurance Board 
(“PEEHIP”). Retired employees age sixty-five or 
older who are eligible for Medicare must enroll in the 
Medicare Coordinated Plan under which Medicare is 
the primary insurer and PEEHIP becomes the 
secondary insurer. Most retirees elect to participate 
in the PEEHIP with TRS, in which case the retirees 
pay a portion of the PEEHIP premium and the 
University pays an allocation toward the cost of 
retiree coverage.  
 
PEEHIP. Plan description. The Alabama Retired 
Education Employees’ Health Care Trust (Trust) is a 
cost-sharing multiple-employer defined benefit 
postemployment healthcare plan that administers 
healthcare benefits to the retirees of participating 
state and local educational institutions. The Trust 

was established under the Alabama Retiree Health 
Care Funding Act of 2007 which authorized and 
directed the Public Education Employees’ Health 
Insurance Board (Board) to create an irrevocable 
trust to fund postemployment healthcare benefits to 
retirees participating in PEEHIP. Active and retiree 
health insurance benefits are paid through the Public 
Education Employees’ Health Insurance Plan 
(PEEHIP). In accordance with GASB, the Trust is 
considered a component unit of the State of 
Alabama (State) and is included in the State’s 
Comprehensive Annual Financial Report. 
 
The PEEHIP was established in 1983 pursuant to 
the provisions of the Code of Alabama 1975, Title 
16, Chapter 25A (Act 83-455) to provide a uniform 
plan of health insurance for active and retired 
employees of state and local educational institutions 
which provide instruction at any combination of 
grades K-14 (collectively, eligible employees), and to 
provide a method for funding the benefits related to 
the plan. The four-year universities participate in the 
plan with respect to their retired employees, and are 
eligible and may elect to participate in the plan with 
respect to their active employees. Responsibility for 
the establishment of the health insurance plan and 
its general administration and operations is vested in 
the Board. The Board is a corporate body for 
purposes of management of the health insurance 
plan.

THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN HUNTSVILLE 

The Code of Alabama 1975, Section 16-25A-4 
provides the Board with the authority to amend the 
benefit provisions in order to provide reasonable 
assurance of stability in future years for the plan. All 
assets of the PEEHIP are held in trust for the payment 
of health insurance benefits. The Teachers’ Retirement 
System of Alabama (TRS) has been appointed as the 
administrator of the PEEHIP and, consequently, serves 
as the administrator of the Trust. 
 
Benefits provided. PEEHIP offers a basic hospital 
medical plan to active members and non-Medicare 
eligible retirees. Benefits include inpatient 
hospitalization for a maximum of 365 days without a 
dollar limit, inpatient rehabilitation, outpatient care, 
physician services, and prescription drugs. 
 
Active employees and non-Medicare eligible retirees 
who do not have Medicare eligible dependents can 
enroll in a health maintenance organization (HMO) in 
lieu of the basic hospital medical plan. The HMO 
includes hospital medical benefits, dental benefits, 
vision benefits, and an extensive formulary. However, 
participants in the HMO are required to receive care 
from a participating physician in the HMO plan.  
 
The PEEHIP offers four optional plans (Hospital 
Indemnity, Cancer, Dental, and Vision) that may be 
selected in addition to or in lieu of the basic hospital 
medical plan or HMO. The Hospital Indemnity Plan 
provides a per-day benefit for hospital confinement, 
maternity, intensive care, cancer, and convalescent 
care. The Cancer Plan covers cancer disease only and 
benefits are provided regardless of other insurance. 
Coverage includes a per-day benefit for each hospital 
confinement related to cancer. The Dental Plan covers 
diagnostic and preventative services, as well as basic 
and major dental services. Diagnostic and preventative 
services include oral examinations, teeth cleaning, x-
rays, and emergency office visits. Basic and major 
services include fillings, general aesthetics, oral 
surgery not covered under a Group Medical Program, 
periodontics, endodontics, dentures, bridgework, and 
crowns. Dental services are subject to a maximum of 
$1,250 per year for individual coverage and $1,000 per 
person per year for family coverage.  The Vision Plan 
covers annual eye examinations, eye glasses, and 
contact lens prescriptions. 
 
PEEHIP members may opt to elect the PEEHIP 
Supplemental Plan as their hospital medical coverage 
in lieu of the PEEHIP Hospital Medical Plan. The 
PEEHIP Supplemental Plan provides secondary 
benefits to the member’s primary plan provided by 
another employer. Only active and non-Medicare 
retiree members and dependents are eligible for the 
PEEHIP Supplemental Plan. There is no premium 
required for this plan, and the plan covers most out-of-

pocket expenses not covered by the primary plan. The 
plan cannot be used as a supplement to Medicare, the 
PEEHIP Hospital Medical Plan, or the State or Local 
Governmental Plans administered by the State 
Employees’ Insurance Board (SEIB).  
 
Effective January 1, 2017, Medicare eligible members 
and Medicare eligible dependents who are covered on 
a retiree contract were enrolled in the United 
Healthcare Group Medicare Advantage plan for 
PEEHIP retirees. The MAPDP plan is fully insured by 
United Healthcare and members are able to have all of 
their Medicare Part A, Part B, and Part D (prescription 
drug coverage) in one convenient plan. With the United 
Healthcare plan for PEEHIP, retirees can continue to 
see their same providers with no interruption and see 
any doctor who accepts Medicare on a national basis. 
Retirees have the same benefits in and out-of-network 
and there is no additional retiree cost share if a retiree 
uses an out-of-network provider and no balance billing 
from the provider. 
 
Contributions. The Code of Alabama 1975, Section 16-
25A-8 and the Code of Alabama 1975, Section, 16-25A
-8.1 provide the Board with the authority to set the 
contribution requirements for plan members and the 
authority to set the employer contribution requirements 
for each required class, respectively. Additionally, the 
Board is required to certify to the Governor and the 
Legislature, the amount, as a monthly premium per 
active employee, necessary to fund the coverage of 
active and retired member benefits for the following 
fiscal year. The Legislature then sets the premium rate 
in the annual appropriation bill.  
 
For employees who retired after September 30, 2005, 
but before January 1, 2012, the employer contribution 
of the health insurance premium set forth by the Board 
for each retiree class is reduced by 2% for each year of 
service less than 25 and increased by 2% percent for 
each year of service over 25 subject to adjustment by 
the Board for changes in Medicare premium costs 
required to be paid by a retiree. In no case does the 
employer contribution of the health insurance premium 
exceed 100% of the total health insurance premium 
cost for the retiree.

For employees who retired after December 31, 2011, 
the employer contribution to the health insurance 
premium set forth by the Board for each retiree class is 
reduced by 4% for each year of service less than 25 
and increased by 2% for each year over 25, subject to 
adjustment by the Board for changes in Medicare 
premium costs required to be paid by a retiree.  
 
In no case does the employer contribution of the health 
insurance premium exceed 100% of the total health 
insurance premium cost for the retiree.  
 
For employees who retired after December 31, 2011, 
who are not covered by Medicare, regardless of years 
of service, the employer contribution to the health 
insurance premium set forth by the Board for each 
retiree class is reduced by a percentage equal to 1% 
multiplied by the difference between the Medicare 
entitlement age and the age of the employee at the 
time of retirement as determined by the Board. This 
reduction in the employer contribution ceases upon 
notification to the Board of the attainment of Medicare 
coverage.  
 
OPEB Liabilities, OPEB Expense, and Deferred 

Outflows of Resources and Deferred Inflows of 
Resources Related to OPEB. At September 30, 2020, 
the financial statements of the University reflected a 
liability of $23.3 million for its proportionate share of the 
net OPEB liability, as prescribed by GASB 75. The net 
OPEB liability was measured as of September 30, 
2019 and the total OPEB liability used to calculate the 
net OPEB liability was determined by an actuarial 
valuation as of September 30, 2018. The University's 
proportion of the net OPEB liability was based on a 
projection of the University’s long-term share of 
contributions to the OPEB plan relative to the projected 
contributions of all participating employers, actuarially 
determined. At September 30, 2019, the University’s 
proportion was 0.62%, which was a decrease of 
0.07% from its proportion measured as of September 
30, 2018.  

 

 
 
 

For the year ended September 30, 2020, the University recognized OPEB expense of ($1.8 million). At Sep-
tember 30, 2020 the System reported deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources related 
to OPEB from the following sources:

Mortality rates for the period after service retirement 
are according to the RP-2000 White Collar Mortality 
Table projected to 2020 using scale BB and 
adjusted 115% for all ages for males and 112% for 
ages 78 and over for females. The rates of disabled 
mortality were based on the RP-2000 
Disabled Mortality Table projected to 2020 using 
scale BB and adjusted 105% for males and 120% 
for females. 
  
The decremental assumptions used in the valuation 
were selected based on the actuarial experience 
study prepared as of September 30, 2015, submitted 
to and adopted by the Teachers’ Retirement System 
of Alabama Board on September 13, 2016. 
  
The remaining actuarial assumptions (e.g., initial per 
capita costs, health care cost trends, rate of plan 
participation, rates of plan election, etc.) were based 
on the September 30, 2018 valuation, however 
updated Medicare Advantage premium rates which 
reflect the repeal of the ACA Health Insurer Fee, 
updated Optionals claims costs, and updated 
participation assumptions were used in this report. 
 
The long-term expected return on plan assets is to 
be reviewed as part of regular experience studies 
prepared every five years, in conjunction with similar 
analysis for the Teachers’ Retirement System of 
Alabama. Several factors should be considered in 
evaluating the long-term rate of return assumption, 
including long-term historical data, estimates 
inherent in current market data, and a log-normal 
distribution analysis in which best-estimate ranges of 
expected future real rates of return (expected return, 

net of investment expense and inflation), as 
developed for each major asset class.  
 
These ranges should be combined to produce the 
long-term expected rate of return by weighting the 
expected future real rates of return by the target 
asset allocation percentage and then adding 
expected inflation. The assumption is intended to be 
a long-term assumption and is not expected to 
change absent a significant change in the asset 
allocation, a change in the inflation assumption, or a 
fundamental change in the market that alters 
expected returns in future years. 
 
The long-term expected rate of return on the OPEB 
plan investments is determined based on the 
allocation of assets by asset class and by the mean 
and variance of real returns. 
 
The target asset allocation and best estimates of 
expected geometric real rates of return for each 
major asset class is summarized below.

Discount rate. The discount rate (also known as the 
Single Equivalent Interest Rate (SEIR), as described 
by GASB 74) used to measure the total OPEB 
liability at September 30, 2019 was 5.50%. The 
discount rate used to measure the total OPEB 
liability at the prior measurement date was 4.44%. 
Premiums paid to the Public Education Employees’ 
Health Insurance Board for active employees shall 
include an amount to partially fund the cost of 
coverage for retired employees. The projection of 
cash flows used to determine the discount rate 
assumed that plan contributions will be made at the 
current contribution rates. Each year, the State 
specifies the monthly employer rate that participating 
school systems must contribute for each active 
employee. Approximately, 24.25% of the employer 
contributions were used to assist in funding retiree 
benefit payments in 2019 and it is assumed that 
once benefit payments exceed employer 
contributions, this amount will increase by 1.00% per 
year and continue into the future. The discount rate 
determination will use a municipal bond rate to the 

extent the trust is projected to run out of money 
before all benefits are paid.  Therefore, the projected 
future benefit payments for all current plan members 
were projected through 2117. The long-term rate of 
return is used until the assets are expected to be 
depleted in 2055, after which the municipal bond 
rate is used.

Note 11 – Federal Direct Student Loan 
Program 
 
The Federal Direct Student Loan Program 
(“FDSLP”) was established under the Higher 
Education Act of 1965, as amended in the Student 
Loan Reform Act of 1993. The FDSLP enables an 
eligible student or parent to obtain a loan to pay for 
the student’s cost of attendance directly through the 
University rather than through private lenders. The 
University began participation in the FDSLP on July 
1, 1995. As a university qualified to originate loans, 
the University is responsible for handling the 
complete loan process, including funds management 
as well as promissory note functions. The University 
is not responsible for collection of these loans. 
During the years ended September 30, 2020 and 
2019, the University disbursed $32,019,179 and 
$33,968,402, respectively, under the FDSLP.  

Note 12 – Contracts and Grants  

 
As of September 30, 2020 and 2019, the University 
was awarded approximately $113.5 million and 
$83.4 million, respectively, in contracts and grants 
which have not been expended. These awards, 
which represent commitments of sponsors to provide 
funds for specific research, training, and service 
projects, have not been reflected in the financial 
statements.

THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN HUNTSVILLE 

Note 14 – Contingencies and 
Commitments 
 
The University has sovereign immunity and is 
therefore, in the opinion of System Counsel, immune 
to ordinary tort actions. The University has 
consistently been dismissed from lawsuits on the 
basis of the sovereign immunity doctrine. That 
doctrine also protects the University from vicarious 
liability arising from the negligence of its employees. 
As a matter of policy, the University has chosen to 
indemnify its employees through a self-insured trust 
fund against liability arising from the performance of 
their official duties. There are some exceptions to the 
sovereign immunity doctrine, most notably in federal 
court cases arising under the federal constitution or 
federal statutes. The University is engaged in various 
legal actions in the ordinary course of business. 
Management does not believe the ultimate outcome 
of those actions will have a material adverse effect on 
the financial statements. However, the settlement of 
legal actions is subject to inherent uncertainties and it 
is possible that such outcomes could differ materially 
from management’s current expectations.  
The University has contracted for the renovation and 

addition of Morton Hall.  At September 30, 2020, the 
estimated remaining cost to complete this project was 
$972 thousand and is expected to be funded from 
University bond proceeds.  

 
Note 15 - Segment Reporting 
 
The University constructed Southeast Housing and 
issued bonds in 1980 and 1981. The bonds were 
payable from revenues received by the University for 
the use and occupancy of the facility. Condensed 
financial information of the University’s segment as of 
September 30, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:

Section 457 Deferred Compensation Plans - an 
amendment of GASB Statements No. 14 and No.

32, in June 2020. The primary objectives of this 
Statement are to (1) increase consistency and 
comparability related to the reporting of fiduciary 
component units in circumstances in which a 
potential component unit does not have a 
governing board and the primary government 
performs the duties that a governing board typically 
would perform; (2) mitigate costs associated with 
the reporting of certain defined contribution pension 
plans, defined contribution other postemployment 
benefit (OPEB) plans, and employee benefit plans 
other than pension plans or OPEB plans (other 
employee benefit plans) as fiduciary component 
units in fiduciary fund financial statements; and (3) 
enhance the relevance, consistency, and 
comparability of the accounting and financial 
reporting for Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 
457 deferred compensation plans (Section 457 
plans) that meet the definition of a pension plan 
and for benefits provided through those plans. The 
requirements in (1) paragraph 4 of this Statement 
as it applies to defined contribution pension plans, 
defined contribution OPEB plans, and other 
employee benefit plans and (2) paragraph 5 of this 
Statement are effective immediately. All other 
requirements of this Statement are effective for 
reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2021. 
The University is evaluating whether there will be 
any material impact from its adoption of GASB 97.
