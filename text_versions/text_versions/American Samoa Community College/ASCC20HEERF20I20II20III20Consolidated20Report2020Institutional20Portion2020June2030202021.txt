Form Instructions 

Completing the Form: On each form, fill out the institution of higher education (IHE or institution) name, the date of the report, the appropriate quarter the 
report covers (September 30, December 31, March 31, June 30), the 11-digit PR/Award Number (number is found in Box 2 of your Grant Award Notification 
(GAN)) for each HEERF grant funding stream as applicable, the total amount of funds awarded by the Department (including reserve funds if awarded), and 
check the box if the report is a “final report.” Institutions that expended HEERF grant funds during the calendar quarter from January 1 – March 30, 2021 are 
required to post the quarterly report that involved the expenditure of HEERF II CRRSAA and HEERF I CARES Act funds. The Department did not previously 
affirmatively indicate this reporting requirement was in place for HEERF II CRRSAA funds. As such, institutions may have until the end of the second calendar 
quarter, June 30, 2021, to post these retroactive reports if they have not already done so. For the July 10, 2021 quarterly reporting deadline, institutions are 
encouraged, but not required to, submit the quarterly reports (this institutional reporting form and the student quarterly report) to the Department by emailing 
those reports as PDF attachments to HEERFreporting@ed.gov. 

In the chart, an institution must specify the amount of expended HEERF I, II, and IIII funds for each funding category: (a)(1) Institutional Portion; (a)(2), and (a)(3), 
if applicable. (a)(2) funds include Assistance Listing Numbers (ALNs) 84.425J (Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs)), 84.425K (Tribally Controlled 
Colleges and Universities (TCCUs)), 84.425L (Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs)), 84.425M (Strengthening Institutions Program (SIP)); (a)(3) funds are for ALN 
84.425N (Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE) Formula Grant) and 84.425S (SAIHE). Each category is deliberately broad and may not 
capture specific grant program requirements. Explanatory footnotes help clarify certain reporting categories. While some items in the chart are blocked out, 
please note that the blocking of such items is consistent with Department guidance and FAQs and is not definitive. Provide brief explanatory notes for how funds 
were expended, including the title and brief description of each project or activity in which funds were expended. Do not include personally identifiable 
information (PII). Calculate the amount of the (a)(1) Institutional Portion, (a)(2) and (a)(3) funds in the “Quarterly Expenditures for each Program” row, and the 
grand total of all three in the “Total of Quarterly Expenditures” row. Round expenditures to the nearest dollar. 

Posting the Form: This form must be conspicuously posted on the institution’s primary website on the same page the reports of the IHE’s activities as to the 
emergency financial aid grants to students made with funds from the IHE’s allocation under (a)(1) of the CARES Act, CRRSAA, and ARP (Student Aid Portion) are 

 
5 Please post additional documentation as appropriate and briefly explain in the “Explanatory Notes” section. Please note that funds for (a)(2) and (a)(3) may be used to defray 
expenses associated with coronavirus (including lost revenue, reimbursement for expenses already incurred, technology costs associated with a transition to distance education, 
faculty and staff trainings, and payroll).

(September 30, December 31, March 31, June 30), concluding after either (1) posting the quarterly report ending September 30, 2023 or (2) when an institution 
has expended and liquidated all (a)(1) Institutional Portion, (a)(2), and (a)(3) funds and checks the “final report” box. IHEs must post this quarterly report form no 
later than 10 days after the end of each calendar quarter (October 10, January 10, April 10, July 10). Each quarterly report must be separately maintained on an 
IHE’s website or in a PDF document linked directly from the IHE’s HEERF reporting webpage. Reports must be maintained for at least three years after the 
submission of the final report per 2 CFR § 200.333. Any changes or updates after initial posting must be conspicuously noted after initial posting and the date of 
the change must be noted in the “Date of Report” line.
