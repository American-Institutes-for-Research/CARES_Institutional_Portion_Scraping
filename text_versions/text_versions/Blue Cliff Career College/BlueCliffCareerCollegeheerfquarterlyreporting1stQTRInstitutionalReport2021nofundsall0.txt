Form Instructions 

Completing the Form: On each form, fill out the institution of higher education (IHE or institution) name, the date of the report, the appropriate quarter the 
report covers (September 30, December 31, March 31, June 30), the total amount of funds awarded by the Department (including reserve funds if awarded), and 
check the box if the report is a “final report.” In the chart, an institution must specify the amount of expended CARES Act funds for each funding category: 
Sections 18004(a)(1) Institutional Portion, 18004(a)(2), and 18004(a)(3), if applicable. Section 18004(a)(2) funds includes CFDAs 84.425J (Historically Black 
Colleges and Universities (HBCUs)), 84.425K (Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities (TCCUs)), 84.425L (Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs)), 84.425M 
(Strengthening Institutions Program (SIP)); Section 18004(a)(3) funds are for CFDA 84.425N (Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE) 
Formula Grant). Each category is deliberately broad and may not capture specific grant program requirements. Explanatory footnotes help clarify certain 
reporting categories. While some items in the chart are blocked out, please note that the blocking of such items is consistent with Department guidance and 
FAQs and is not definitive. Provide brief explanatory notes for how funds were expended, including the title and brief description of each project or activity in 
which funds were expended. Do not include personally identifiable information (PII). Calculate the amount of the Section 18004(a)(1) Institutional Portion 
(referred to as “(a)(1) institutional” in the chart), Section 18004(a)(2) (referred to as “(a)(2)” in the chart), and Section 18004(a)(3) (referred to as “(a)(3)” in the 
chart) funds in the “Quarterly Expenditures for each Program” row, and the grand total of all three in the “Total of Quarterly Expenditures” row. Round 
expenditures to the nearest dollar.

emergency financial aid grants to students made with funds from the IHE’s allocation under Section 18004(a)(1) of the CARES Act (Student Aid Portion) are 
posted. It may be posted in an HTML webpage format or as a link to a PDF. A new separate form must be posted covering each quarterly reporting period 
(September 30, December 31, March 31, June 30), concluding after either (1) posting the quarterly report ending September 30, 2022 or (2) when an institution 
has expended and liquidated all (a)(1) Institutional Portion, (a)(2), and (a)(3) funds and checks the “final report” box. IHEs must post this quarterly report form no 

payment to contractors for the provision of pre-enrollment recruitment activities; endowments; or capital outlays associated with facilities related to athletics, sectarian 
instruction, or religious worship.”
