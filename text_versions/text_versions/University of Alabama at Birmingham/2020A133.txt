Report of Independent Auditors on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and on 
Compliance and Other Matters Based on an Audit of Financial Statements Performed 

in Accordance with Government Auditing Standards 
 
To the Board of Trustees of The University of Alabama: 
 
We have audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of 
America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing 
Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of the 
business-type activities and the discretely presented component unit of The University of Alabama 
at Birmingham (“UAB”), a campus of the University of Alabama System, which is a component unit 
of the State of Alabama, which comprise the statements of net position as of September 30, 2020, 
and the related statements of revenues, expenses, and changes in net position and of cash flows 
(where applicable) for the year then ended, and the related notes to the  financial statements, and 
have issued our report thereon dated January 21, 2021. Our report includes an emphasis of matter 
regarding the presentation of the financial statements as discussed in Note 1 to the financial 
statements. Our report includes a reference to other auditors who audited the financial statements 
of Southern Research Institute, as described in our report on UAB’s financial statements. This 
report does not include the results of the other auditors’ testing of internal control over financial 
reporting or compliance and other matters that are reported on separately by those auditors. The 
financial statements of Triton Health Systems, L.L.C., UAB Athletics Foundation and UAB Research 
Foundation were not audited in accordance with Government Auditing Standards and accordingly, 
this report does not include reporting on internal control over financial reporting or instances of 
reportable noncompliance associated with these component units.     
    
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered UAB’s internal 
control over financial reporting (“internal control”) as a basis for designing the audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the 
financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
UAB's internal control.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the UAB's 
internal control. 
 
A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow 
management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, 
or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a 
combination of deficiencies, in internal control such that there is a reasonable possibility that a 
material misstatement of the entity's financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and 
corrected on a timely basis.  A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of 
deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough 
to merit attention by those charged with governance. 
 
Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of 
this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be 
material weaknesses or significant deficiencies.  Given these limitations, during our audit we did 
not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses.  
However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified.

Compliance and Other Matters 
 
As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether UAB’s financial statements are free from 
material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, 
regulations, contracts and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and 
material effect on the financial statements.  However, providing an opinion on compliance with 
those provisions was not an objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an 
opinion.  The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are 
required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards.   
 
Purpose of this Report 
 
The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and 
compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
entity’s internal control or on compliance.  This report is an integral part of an audit performed in 
accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the entity’s internal control and 
compliance.  Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

Report of Independent Auditors on Compliance with Requirements  

That Could Have a Direct and Material Effect on Each Major Program and on Internal Control Over 

Compliance in Accordance with the Uniform Guidance  

 

To the Board of Trustees of The University of Alabama: 

Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program 

We have audited The University of Alabama at Birmingham’s (”UAB”), a campus of The University of 
Alabama System, which is a component unit of the State of Alabama, compliance with the types of 
compliance requirements described in the OMB Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and 
material effect on each of UAB’s major federal programs for the year ended September 30, 2020.  UAB’s 
major federal programs are identified in the summary of auditor’s results section of the accompanying 
schedule of findings and questioned costs. 

UAB’s basic financial statements include the operations of Southern Research Institute (“SRI”), UAB’s 
discretely presented component unit, which expended $47,548,107 in federal awards during its year 
ended December 28, 2018 which is not included in UAB’s schedule of expenditures of federal awards for 
the year ended September 30, 2019. Our audit, described below, did not include the operations of SRI 
because SRI engaged other auditors to perform an audit in accordance with the Uniform Guidance. 

Management’s Responsibility 

Management is responsible for compliance with federal statutes, regulations and the terms and conditions 
of its federal awards applicable to its federal programs.   

Auditors’ Responsibility 

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of UAB’s major federal programs based 
on our audit of the types of compliance requirements referred to above.  We conducted our audit of 
compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the 
standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the 
Comptroller General of the United States; and the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal 
Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for 
Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance).  Those standards and the Uniform Guidance require that we plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether noncompliance with the types of 
compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on a major federal 
program occurred.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about UAB’s compliance with 
those requirements and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the 
circumstances.   

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for each major 
federal program.  However, our audit does not provide a legal determination of UAB’s compliance. 

Opinion on Each Major Federal Program 

In our opinion, the University of Alabama at Birmingham complied, in all material respects, with the types 
of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its 
major federal programs for the year ended September 30, 2020.

Report on Internal Control Over Compliance 

Management of UAB is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over 
compliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above.  In planning and performing our 
audit of compliance, we considered UAB’s internal control over compliance with the types of requirements 
that could have a direct and material effect on each major federal program to determine the auditing 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing an opinion on 
compliance for each major federal program and to test and report on internal control over compliance in 
accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of internal control over compliance.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the 
effectiveness of UAB ‘s internal control over compliance. 

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over 
compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned 
functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a 
federal program on a timely basis.  A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a 
deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a 
reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal 
program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis.  A significant deficiency in 
internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over 
compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material 
weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged 
with governance.    

Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the first 
paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over 
compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies.  We did not identify any 
deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses.  However, 
material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. 

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our testing 
of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of the 
Uniform Guidance.  Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.  

Report on Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards Required by the Uniform Guidance  

We have audited the financial statements of the business-type activities and the discretely presented 
component unit of UAB as of and for the year ended September 30, 2020, and the related notes to the 
financial statements, which collectively comprise UAB’s basic financial statements.  We issued our report 
thereon dated January 21, 2021, which contained unmodified opinions on those financial statements.  Our 
audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively 
comprise the basic financial statements.  The accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal awards 
is presented for purposes of additional analysis as required by the Uniform Guidance and is not a required 
part of the basic financial statements.  Such information is the responsibility of management and was 
derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic 
financial statements.  The information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit 
of the financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such 
information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial 
statements or to the basic financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in 



 

 3 

accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America.  In our opinion, 
the schedule of expenditures of federal awards is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the 
basic financial statements as a whole.

The University of Alabama at Birmingham 
Notes to Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards 
Year Ended September 30, 2020 

34 

1. Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (the “Schedule”) summarizes the 
federal expenditures of The University of Alabama at Birmingham (“UAB”), a campus of the 
University of Alabama System, under programs of the federal government for the year ended 
September 30, 2020.  Other campuses of the University of Alabama System are presented in 
separate reports.  The amounts reported as federal expenditures were obtained from UAB’s 
general ledger.  The information in this Schedule is presented in accordance with the requirements 
of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost 
Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance).  Therefore, some 
amounts presented in this Schedule may differ from amounts presented in, or used in the 
preparation of, the statements of net position, the related statements of revenues, expenses, and 
changes in net position and cash flows of UAB.  The federal expenditures of Southern Research 
Institute (“SRI”), a discretely presented component unit of UAB, have not been included within the 
Schedule as they have been included in a separate schedule of expenditures of federal awards 
that has been audited by other auditors. 

The blended component units of UAB include UAB Research Foundation, UAB Athletics 
Foundation, Alabama Care Plan, UAB Hospital Management, L.L.C, and Triton Health Systems, 
L.L.C.  These component units do not expend federal awards and therefore are not subject to 
requirements of the Uniform Guidance. 

For purposes of the Schedule, federal awards include all grants, contracts, and similar agreements 
entered into directly between UAB and agencies and departments of the federal government and 
all subawards to UAB by nonfederal organizations pursuant to federal grants, contracts, and similar 
agreements.  Negative amounts represent adjustments or credits to amounts reported as 
expenditures in prior years.  Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (“CFDA”) numbers and pass-
through numbers are provided when available. 

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

For purposes of the Schedule, expenditures for federal award programs are recognized on the 
accrual basis of accounting.  Such expenditures are recognized following the cost principles 
contained in the Uniform Guidance where certain types of expenditures are not allowable or are 
limited to reimbursement.  

3. Facilities and Administrative Costs (“F&A Costs”) 

UAB applies its predetermined approved facilities and administrative rate when charging indirect 
cost to federal awards rather than the 10% de minimis cost rate described in Section 200.414 of 
the Uniform Guidance.  UAB operates under predetermined fixed F&A cost rates which are 
effective from October 1, 2015 through September 30, 2020.  The predetermined fixed rates were 
based on 2014 financial information.  The base rate for on-campus research is 48.5% for the year 
ended September 30, 2020.  Base rates for other F&A cost recoveries range from 5.4% to 48.5% 
for the year ended September 30, 2020.

4. Federal Student Loan Programs 

Direct Loan Programs 
The Perkins, Health Professions Student Loan (“HPSL”), Nurse Faculty Loan Program (“NFLP”), 
and Loans to Disadvantaged Students (“LDS”) programs are administered directly by UAB, and 
balances and transactions relating to these programs are included in UAB’s basic financial 
statements. 

The balances of loans outstanding at September 30, 2020 under the federal student loan programs 
are summarized as follows: 

Perkins HPSL NFLP LDS NFLP-ARRA
(CFDA#84.038) (CFDA#93.342) (CFDA#93.264) (CFDA#93.342) (CFDA#93.408) Total

Total loan balance outstanding, September 30, 2020 7,834,550$             1,057,267$             3,224,756$             128,309$                62,639$                  12,307,521$            

Federal Direct Loans 
The Federal Direct Student Loan (FDSL) program (CFDA Number 84.268) was established under 
the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended in the Student Loan Reform Act of 1993.  The 
FDSL enables an eligible student or parent to obtain a loan to pay for the student’s cost of 
attendance directly through UAB rather than through private lenders.  UAB began participation in 
the FDSL on July 1, 1994.  As a university qualified to originate loans, UAB is responsible for 
handling the complete loan origination process, including funds management and promissory note 
functions.  UAB is not responsible for collection of these loans.

Introduction to UAB

Vision
To be an internationally renowned 
research university — a first choice for 
education and health care.

Mission
UAB serves students, patients, the 
community and the global need for 
discovery, knowledge dissemination, 
education, creativity and the 
application of groundbreaking 
solutions. We are a leader among 
comprehensive public urban research 
universities with academic medical 
centers.

The University of Alabama at 
Birmingham (UAB) became an 
autonomous campus within The 
University of Alabama System in 1969 
and, in the five decades since, has 
grown into a world-renowned 
research university and medical 
center, occupying more than 100 city 
blocks in Alabama’s largest 
metropolitan area. UAB is the state’s 
largest single-site employer with 
more than 23,000 employees. One in 
four Birmingham residents are UAB 
employees, students or patients.

2020 Overview
In fall 2020 UAB achieved a fifth 
consecutive year of record 
enrollment with 22,536 students as 
well as record retention of 86.4 
percent. The freshman class is the 
most academically prepared ever, 
with an average ACT of 25.9 and an 
average high school GPA of 3.83. 
Underrepresented students make up 
43 percent of the enrollment and 21 
percent of undergraduates are first-
generation college students.

UAB's research enterprise is more 
competitive than ever. In FY20, 
research awards reached a record 
$638 million, marking the most 
successful five-year period of 
research funding in the university's 
history, with an increase of $190 
million (42 percent) from 2015 to 
2020.

UAB ranks 15th (top 4 percent) in 
federal research funding and 9th (top 
2 percent) in NIH funding, with nine 
School of Medicine departments 
ranked in the top 15 nationally.

UAB received the 2020 Higher 
Education Excellence in Diversity 
Award from INSIGHT into Diversity 
Magazine and is one of only 14 
universities named a Diversity 
Champion.

As a globally respected academic 
medical center, UAB excels at 
translating research into leading-
edge patient care. UAB is home to 
the 18th largest hospital in the U.S. 
(and 3rd largest public), the state’s 
only Level 1 Adult Trauma Center, and 
the only National Cancer Institute-
designated comprehensive cancer 
center in Alabama and a four-state 
region. 

The new Proton Therapy Center, 
which opened in January 2020, 
offers the most advanced radiation 
technology available for treating 
cancer, and is one of only 36 such 
centers in the U.S. and the first in 
Alabama. U.S. News & World Report  
ranked UAB the number one hospital 
in Alabama, with 10 specialties among 
the nation's top 50.

At the same time, UAB continues to 
offer unrivaled research opportunities 
and novel academic programs, such 
as a new BS in cancer biology and 
PhD in neuro-engineering, the first 
programs of their kind in the nation. 
UAB graduate programs continue to 
rank highly in US News & World 
Report, with 17 programs in the top 
25, including a Master’s in Health 
Administration that is number one 
nationally.

UAB has an economic impact on 
Alabama that exceeds $7.15 billion 
annually and is key in growing a 
robust tech and knowledge-based 
economy for the Birmingham region 
and Alabama.

The UAB Harbert Institute for 
Innovation and Entrepreneurship 
generated 83 intellectual property 
disclosures, 16 U.S. patents and 
seven start-up companies in FY2020 
alone—the Institute’s sixth straight 
year to achieve a positive bottom line, 
among only 20 percent of university 
tech transfer offices nationally to do 
so. Innovation Depot, in which UAB is 
a founding partner, is the largest 
high-tech business incubator in the 
Southeast, with 100 start-up 
companies and more than 1,000 
employees.

UAB has been a leader in combating 
the COVID-19 pandemic through 
frontline patient care, research and 
shared expertise. Through November 
2020, UAB treated over 2,000 
COVID-positive patients, offering 
many of them the opportunity to take 
part in studies of new treatments 
available at only a handful of medical 
centers worldwide, including the first 
clinical trials of the antiviral drug 
Remdesivir as well as promising 
vaccines. UAB Infectious disease 
experts are routinely interviewed on 
major media outlets such as CNN, 
FOX News, and NBC with an 
estimated audience of 2.7 billion 
around the U.S. and the globe.

The information included in this 
introduction (pages 2-7) does not 
include data related to component 
units of UAB that are discussed in the 
notes to the financial statements.

Hospital
Overview
The University of Alabama Hospital (the "Hospital" or 
“University Hospital”), a 1,157-bed quaternary and tertiary 
care medical facility is the flagship facility of the UAB 
Health System and is the primary teaching hospital for 
University of Alabama School of Medicine. Its facilities 
consist of the UAB Women and Infants Center, the 
Hazelrig-Salter Radiation Oncology Center, the North 
Pavilion Diagnostic and Treatment Center, Spain 
Rehabilitation Center, the Center for Psychiatric Medicine, 
UAB Highlands, and the Gardendale Freestanding 
Emergency Department. University Hospital operates The 
Kirklin Clinic and The Whitaker Clinic. The University 
Hospital also has strong ties with other governmental and 
private non-profit institutions located within and adjacent 
to the UAB campus, including Veterans Affairs Medical 
Center and Children’s Hospital. Other healthcare facilities 
in the UAB Health System include the UAB Callahan Eye 
Hospital Authority, Medical West Hospital Authority, and 
The Health Care Authority for Baptist Health.

University Hospital Awards and 
Accolades
This year’s U.S. News and World Report’s “Best Hospitals” 
special edition issue ranked eight UAB Medicine 
specialties among the nation’s top 50 and six specialties 
among the top 25. U.S. News and World Report also 
ranked hospitals in adult procedures and conditions. 
University Hospital is ranked high performing, which is the 
highest ranking conferred, in eight adult procedures and 
conditions. Becker’s Hospital Review named University 
Hospital as one of the 2020 “100 Great Hospitals in 
America,” a compilation of hospitals that are considered 
industry innovators and known nationally for excellence in 
clinical care. In November 2019, University Hospital was 
named a Magnet-designated organization for the fifth 
consecutive time by the American Nurses Credentialing 
Center Magnet Recognition Program®. University Hospital 
is only the 21st hospital worldwide to receive this 
designation five consecutive times. Magnet hospitals are 
recognized for excellence in nursing care and patient 
outcomes. Additionally, University Hospital was named 
Best in Class, and designated as one of the top 10 
hospitals in the country on the Consumer Loyalty list, 
based on results from NRC Health’s Market Insights 
survey, the largest database of health care consumer 
responses in the country. Once again, University Hospital 
was named as an LGBTQ Healthcare Equality Leader for 
2020, scoring a perfect 100 in the organization’s five 
criteria.

Operations
In January 2020, the World Health Organization declared 
the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) a Public Health 
Emergency of International Concern. The outbreak of 
COVID-19 has caused domestic and global disruption in 
operations for healthcare organizations. These 
disruptions were evident in the decreases in the 
University Hospital's data points disclosed below:

For the fiscal year 2020, inpatient discharges decreased 
3.8% and adjusted patient discharges decreased 6.6%. 
Operating room cases decreased 7.2% over fiscal year 
2019. Also emergency room visits decreased 5.0% during 
fiscal year 2020. The Hospital had an increase in net 
position of $138 million in fiscal year 2020.

Office of the Senior Vice President for Finance and Administration

Management’s Responsibility for Financial Reporting

The accompanying financial statements of the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) for the 
years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 were prepared by UAB’s management in conformity 
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

The management of UAB is responsible for the integrity and objectivity of these financial 
statements, which are presented on the accrual basis of accounting and, accordingly, include some 
amounts based upon judgement. Other financial information in the annual report is consistent with 
that in the financial statements. The system of internal accounting controls is designed to help 
ensure that the financial reports and the books properly reflect the transactions of the institution, in 
accordance with established policies and procedures as implemented by qualified personnel.

The Board of Trustees of The University of Alabama, through its Audit, Risk and Compliance 
Committee, monitors the financial and accounting operations of the institution, including the review 
and discussion of periodic financial statements and the evaluation and adoption of budgets. The 
Board of Trustees of The University of Alabama, through its Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee, 
monitors the basis of engagement and reporting of independent auditors.

Report of Independent Auditors 
 
To the Board of Trustees of The University of Alabama: 
 
Report on the Financial Statements 
 
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the business-type activities and the 
discretely presented component unit of The University of Alabama at Birmingham (”UAB”), a 
campus of The University of Alabama System, which is a component unit of the State of Alabama, 
which comprise the statements of net position as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, and the related 
statements of revenues, expenses, and changes in net position and of cash flows (where applicable) 
for the years then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively 
comprise UAB’s basic financial statements.   
 
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements 
 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in 
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this 
includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the 
preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error. 
 
Auditors’ Responsibility 
 
Our responsibility is to express opinions on the financial statements based on our audits. We did 
not audit the financial statements of Southern Research Institute (“SRI”), UAB’s discretely 
presented component unit, as of December 27, 2019 and December 28, 2018 and for the years then 
ended. Those statements were audited by other auditors whose report thereon has been furnished 
to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for SRI, is based solely on the 
report of the other auditors. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards 
generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits 
contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United 
States.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.  The financial 
statements of Triton Health Systems, L.L.C., UAB Athletics Foundation, and UAB Research 
Foundation were not audited in accordance with Government Auditing Standards. 
 
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on our judgment, including 
the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to 
fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to UAB’s 
preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of UAB’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also 
includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of 
significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
presentation of the financial statements.  We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. 
 



 

2 
 

Opinions 
 
In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of other auditors, the financial statements 
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the respective financial position of the 
business-type activities and the discretely presented component unit of The University of Alabama 
at Birmingham as of September 30, 2020 and 2019 and the respective changes in financial position 
and, where applicable, cash flows thereof for the years then ended in accordance with accounting 
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
Emphasis of Matter 
 
As discussed in Note 1, the financial statements of UAB are intended to present the financial 
position, the changes in financial position and, where applicable, the cash flows of only that portion 
of the business-type activities of the financial reporting entity of The University of Alabama System 
that is attributable to the transactions of UAB.  They do not purport to, and do not, present fairly 
the financial position of The University of Alabama System as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, the 
changes in its financial position, or, where applicable, its cash flows for the years then ended in 
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Our 
opinion is not modified with respect to this matter. 
 
Other Matters 
 
Required Supplementary Information 
 
The accompanying management’s discussion and analysis on pages 11 through 19 and the 
accompanying supplementary information on pages 70 through 72 are required by accounting 
principles generally accepted in the United States of America to supplement the basic financial 
statements.   Such information, although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by 
the Governmental Accounting Standards Board who considers it to be an essential part of financial 
reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or 
historical context.  We have applied certain limited procedures to the required supplementary 
information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of 
America, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the 
information and comparing the information for consistency with management's responses to our 
inquiries, the basic financial statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audits of the 
basic financial statements.  We do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the 
information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidence to express an 
opinion or provide any assurance. 
 
Other Information 
 
Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that 
collectively comprise UAB’s basic financial statements. The introductory information on pages 2 
through 7 and the management’s report on page 8 are presented for purposes of additional analysis 
and are not a required part of the basic financial statements. Such information has not been 
subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the basic financial statements, and 
accordingly, we do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on it.

Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards 
 
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated January 
21, 2021, on our consideration of UAB’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of 
its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, grant agreements, and other 
matters for the year ended September 30, 2020.  The purpose of that report is to describe the scope 
of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that 
testing, and not to provide an opinion on internal control over financial reporting or on compliance.  
That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing 
Standards in considering the UAB’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Unaudited)

The objective of management’s discussion and analysis is to help readers of UAB’s financial statements better 
understand the financial position and operating activities for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019. This 
discussion  has been prepared by management along with the financial statements and related note disclosures and 
should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes. The financial statements, notes, required 
supplementary information, and this discussion are the responsibility of management. In January 2020, the World 
Health Organization declared the novel Coronavirus ("COVID-19") a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. 
The outbreak of COVID-19 has caused domestic and global disruption in operations for institutions of higher education 
and healthcare organizations and has impacted several areas of UAB and University Hospital's financial statements as 
further discussed within the MD&A and Note 1.

Overview of Financial Statements
UAB’s financial statements present the financial position, 
changes in financial position, and the cash flows of the 
University, the University of Alabama Hospital (the 
"Hospital" or “University Hospital"), and UAB’s blended 
component units. Condensed financial information of 
UAB’s reportable segments is presented at Note 15. 
GASB Statement No. 14, The Financial Reporting Entity 
(GASB Statement No. 14), as amended by GASB 
Statement No. 61, The Financial Reporting Entity: 
Omnibus-an amendment of GASB Statements No. 14 and 
No. 34 (GASB Statement No. 61), requires governmental 
entities to include in their financial statements as 
component units, organizations that are legally separate 
entities for which the governmental entity, as a primary 
organization, is financially accountable. 

Southern Research Institute (SRI) is a discretely presented 
component unit of UAB. SRI’s performance is not 
discussed below. However, SRI’s Statement of Net 
Position and Statements of Revenues, Expenses, and 
Changes in Net Position are disclosed on pages 25-26. 

Blended component units included within the financial 
information of UAB are UAB Research Foundation 
(UABRF), UAB Athletics Foundation (UABAF), Alabama 
Care Plan (ACP), Hospital Management L.L.C. (LLC), and 
Triton Health Systems, L.L.C. (Triton).

The following discussion and analysis provides an 
overview of UAB’s financial activities. UAB’s financial 
position remained strong, as assets totaled $5.93, $5.53, 
and $5.05 billion at September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, 
respectively.  Increases of $399.6 million or 7.2% from 
September  30, 2019 to September  30, 2020 were 
primarily due to increases in cash and cash equivalents, 
investments, and capital assets. Increases of $479.0 
million or 9.5% from September  30, 2018 to 
September  30, 2019 were primarily due to increases in 
investments, cash designated for capital activities, and 
capital assets. 

Total liabilities decreased $101.4  million or 2.9% from 
September  30, 2019 to September  30, 2020. The 
decrease results primarily from a decrease in the OPEB 
liability. Total liabilities increased $255.7  million or 7.8% 
from September  30, 2018 to September  30, 2019. The 
increase results  primarily from the issuance of bonds 
during fiscal year 2019. The increase also relates to 
growth in accounts payable and accrued liabilities as well 
as an increase in the OPEB liability. 

The change in net position reflects the operating, 
nonoperating and other activity of UAB, which results 
from revenues, expenses, and gains and losses, and is 
summarized for the years ended September  30, 2020, 
2019, and 2018, as follows:

2020 2019 2018

TOTAL OPERATING REVENUES $ 3,712,470,836 $ 3,602,383,812 $ 3,404,474,421

At September  30, 2020, the major categories of current 
assets consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, 
short-term investments, and accounts receivable, which 
totaled $2.40 billion of the $2.54 billion and increased 
$464.8 million or 22.4% from 2019. The increase is a 
result of more cash held on hand, some growth in short 
term investments due to an increase in earnings 
reinvested, temporary cost cutting measures out of 
precaution of pandemic impact, and deferred payments of 
the employer share of Social Security taxes allowable 
under the CARES Act

At September  30, 2019, the major categories of current 
assets consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, 
short-term investments, and accounts receivable, which 
totaled $1.95 billion of the $2.07 billion and increased 
$242.4 million or 13.3% from 2018. The increase is a result 
of growth in short term investments and accounts 
receivable.

At September 30, 2020, total current liabilities of $800.2 
million consist primarily of accounts payable, accrued 
payroll and related benefits, and unearned revenue, 
which totaled $746.4 million, compared to $493.2 million 

at September  30, 2019, an increase of $253 million or 
51.3% from 2019. The increase is primarily due to an 
increase in hospital related payables.

At September  30, 2019, total current liabilities of 
$544.3  million consist primarily of accounts payable, 
accrued payroll and related benefits, and unearned 
revenue, which totaled $493.2  million, compared to 
$483.4 million at September 30, 2018, an  increase of $10 
million or 2.0% from 2018. The increase is a result of an 
increase in salary and benefits related accruals.

UAB’s endowment and life income investments increased 
$2.5 million or 0.5% to $540.0 million from September 30, 
2019 to September 30, 2020. This increase resulted from 
the establishment of new endowment funds through gifts 
and the creation of Board-designated quasi-endowments 
throughout the year, offset by investment performance. 

UAB’s endowment and life income investments increased 
$12.7 million or 2.4% to $537.5 million from 
September  30, 2018 to September  30, 2019. This 
increase resulted from the establishment of new 
endowment funds through gifts and the creation of Board-

12



designated quasi-endowments throughout the year, offset 
by investment performance.

UAB’s endowment funds are invested in common 
investment pools established by The Board of Trustees of 
The University of Alabama (the Board). The funds are 
invested to maximize total return over the long term, with 
an appropriate level of risk. Any short term reduction in 
the fair value of the endowment portfolio will not have a 
meaningful immediate impact on the portion of 
investment income available to support current year 
operating expenses since such distributions are made 
pursuant to The University of Alabama System’s (the 
System) spending rate policy. UAB’s endowment funds 
consists of both permanent and quasi-endowments. 
Permanent endowment funds are those funds received 
from donors with the requirement that the principal 
remain unspent and invested in perpetuity to produce 
income to be expended for the purposes specified by the 
donor. Quasi- endowments consist of restricted or 
unrestricted funds that have been set aside by actions of 
the Board to produce income for an established purpose 
until the time the Board reverses its action. Endowment 
income supports scholarships, fellowships, 
professorships, research efforts, and other programs and 
activities of UAB.

At September  30, 2020, 2019, and 2018 respectively, 
UAB’s investment in the Professional Liability Trust Fund 
(PLTF) totaled approximately $59.9, $60.3, and $67.3 
million. The $0.4  million decrease from September  30, 
2019 to September  30, 2020 is a result of a decline in 
investment values at September  30, 2020. The 
$7.0  million decrease from September  30, 2018 to 
September 30, 2019 is a result of a decline in investment 
values at September 30, 2019.

At September 30, 2020, deferred outflows from pension 
obligations were $198.6 million and deferred inflows from 
pension obligations were $90.2 million. At September 30, 
2019, deferred outflows from pension obligations were 
$185.1  million and deferred inflows from pension 
obligations were $142.7 million. The increase in deferred 
outflows from pension obligations is a result of the net 
difference between projected and actual earnings on 
pension plan investments. The decrease in deferred 
inflows from pension obligations is the result of the net 
difference between projected and actual earnings on 
pension plan investments.

At September  30, 2019, deferred outflows from pension 
obligations were $185.1 million and deferred inflows from 
pension obligations were $142.7 million. At September 30, 
2018, deferred outflows from pension obligations were 
$160.5  million and deferred inflows from pension 
obligations were $147.1  million. The increase in deferred 
outflows from pension obligations is a result of an 
increase in differences between expected and actual 
experience. The decrease in deferred inflows from 
pension obligations is the result of a decrease in 

differences between expected and actual experience,  
changes in proportion, and differences between employer 
contributions and proportionate share of contributions.

At September  30, 2020, deferred outflows from OPEB 
obligations were $106.9 million and deferred inflows from 
OPEB obligations were $431.8  million. At September  30, 
2019, deferred outflows from OPEB obligations were 
$116.4 million and deferred inflows from OPEB obligations 
were $82.1 million. The decrease  in the deferred outflows 
from OPEB obligations is a result of a changes in 
proportion and differences between employer 
contributions and proportionate share of contributions. 
The increase in deferred inflows from OPEB obligation is 
a result of a difference between expected and actual 
experience.

At September  30, 2019, deferred outflows from OPEB 
obligations were $116.4 million and deferred inflows from 
OPEB obligations were $82.1  million. At September  30, 
2018, deferred outflows from OPEB obligations were 
$123.7  million and  and deferred inflows from OPEB 
obligations were $71.1  million. The decrease in the 
deferred outflows from OPEB obligations is a result of  
changes in proportion and differences between employer 
contributions and proportionate share of contributions. 
The increase in deferred inflows from OPEB obligation is 
a result of a change in proportion and differences 
between employer contributions and proportionate share 
of contributions.

GASB Statements No. 68 and 75 require governmental 
employers participating in multi-employer cost-sharing 
pension and healthcare benefit plans to recognize 
liabilities for their proportionate share of the unfunded 
liability for plans whose actuarial liabilities exceed the 
plan’s net assets. As required by Alabama statute, all 
eligible employees of a qualifying public educational 
employer must be a member of the Teacher’s Retirement 
System of Alabama (TRS). As a qualifying employer, UAB 
is required to make certain employer contributions on 
behalf of its employees participating in TRS’s defined 
benefit pension plan. Additionally, Alabama statutes 
permitted UAB to opt-in to provide its eligible retirees with 
healthcare benefits through the Public Education 
Employees’ Health Insurance Plan (PEEHIP).

The employer contribution rates for both plans are 
established annually by TRS and PEEHIP, and adopted by 
the Alabama Legislature. Both the TRS employer 
contribution rate and the employer’s PEEHIP cost for 
retiree coverage are based upon the actuarial valuations 
performed by TRS and PEEHIP, respectively. Although the 
liabilities recognized under GASB 68 and 75 meet GASB’s 
definition of a liability within GASB’s framework for 
accounting standards, UAB does not believe that the 
associated recorded liabilities constitute legal liability for 
UAB, nor do they open UAB to other claims on its 
resources.

At September  30, 2020, deferred outflows from debt 
refundings were $13.3  million with no deferred inflows 
from debt refundings.  At September  30, 2019, deferred 
outflows from debt refundings were $12.3  million and 
deferred inflows from debt refundings were $41 thousand. 
The increase of $1.0  million in deferred outflows from 
September 30, 2019 to September 30, 2020 is the result 
of new debt issuances. 

At September  30, 2019, deferred outflows from debt 
refundings were $12.3 million and deferred inflows from 
debt refundings were $41 thousand. At September  30, 
2018, deferred outflows from debt refundings were $13.3 
million and deferred inflows from debt refundings were 
$54 thousand. These changes from September 30, 2018 
to September  30, 2019 are related to the annual 
amortization of these balances.

Capital and Debt Activities
An aspect of UAB’s continued growth is an emphasis on 
the expansion and maintenance of capital assets. UAB 
continues to implement its long-range capital plan. Capital 
assets primarily include land, buildings, fixed equipment 
systems, and inventoried equipment. The original costs of 
capital assets increased  approximately $184.3 million and 
$188.3 million from September 30, 2019 to September 30, 
2020 and from September  30, 2018 to September  30, 
2019, respectively. The year over year increase consists 
primarily of additions totaling $214.4 million (offset 
primarily by $30.0 million in disposals) and $227.0 million 
(offset primarily by $38.7 million in disposals) in 2020 and 
2019, respectively. Capital additions are comprised 
primarily of renovation and new construction of student, 
research and health care facilities, as well as additions to 
improve information technology systems. 

Annual additions were funded with capital funds, grants, 
gifts of $1.9 million and $0.8 million, debt proceeds of 
$63.1 million and $29.6 million, and the remainder by UAB 

funds designated for capital purchases in 2020 and 2019, 
respectively. 

Capital projects in process at September  30, 2020 
include Central Utilities, McCallum Building renovations, 
Green Hall (a new residence hall) and Information and 
Technology Center. Capital projects in process at 
September  30, 2019 include Central Utilities, McCallum 
Building renovations, Science and Engineering Building, 
Honors College, and Information and Technology Center. 

UAB’s long-term debt related to capital assets, consisting 
of bonds and capital leases, totaled $1.13, $1.16, and 
$0.94  billion at September  30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, 
respectively. The decrease in debt during 2020 consisted 
primarily of the principal payments made in accordance 
with the debt instruments. The increase in debt during 
2019 consisted primarily of the $170.7 million General 
Revenue Bonds, Series 2019  issued during the year. 

Net Position
Net position represents the residual interest in UAB’s 
assets and deferred outflows after liabilities and deferred 
inflows are deducted. 

UAB’s net position at September  30, 2020, 2019, and 
2018, is summarized as follows:

2020 2019 2018

NET INVESTMENT IN CAPITAL ASSETS $ 769,281,767 $ 759,496,749 $ 744,768,861 

RESTRICTED

Nonexpendable  405,615,948  401,733,396  386,738,832 

Expendable  353,055,159  377,422,933  354,341,414 

UNRESTRICTED  759,386,626  539,742,362  359,587,377 

TOTAL NET POSITION $ 2,287,339,500 $ 2,078,395,440 $ 1,845,436,484 

Net position invested in capital assets represent UAB’s 
capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation and 
outstanding principal of debt in excess of related bond 
proceeds attributable to the acquisition, construction, or 
improvement of those assets. The $9.8 million increase in 
2020 reflects the growth in capital assets net of annual 
depreciation expense, along with the decrease in total 
debt related to the annual principal payments. The 
$14.7  million increase in 2019 reflects reflects continued 

capital asset development in accordance with UAB’s long-
range capital plan, offset by the increase in debt related 
to the bonds issued during the year.

Restricted nonexpendable net position includes UAB’s 
permanent endowment funds and annuity and life income 
assets that will ultimately become pure endowment funds. 
The $3.9  million increase in 2020 and the $15.0  million 
increase in 2019 relates to contributions made and 
investment performance at year-end.

14



Restricted expendable net position is subject to externally 
imposed restrictions governing its use. Restricted 
expendable net position includes UAB’s assets whose 
use is restricted by an external restriction. The 
$24.4 million decrease in 2020 is the result of fewer new 
gifts received during the year. The $23.1 million increase 
in 2019 resulted primarily from new gifts received during 
the year.

Unrestricted net position includes UAB’s assets whose 
use is not restricted by an external entity. Unrestricted net 

position increased by $219.6 million or 40.7% in 2020 and 
increased by $180.2  million or 50.1%  in 2019, 
respectively. Although unrestricted net position is not 
subject to externally imposed restrictions, UAB has 
designated available unrestricted net position to be used 
for academic and research programs as well as capital 
projects.

Statements of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Position
The statement of revenues, expenses, and changes in net 
position presents UAB’s results of operations, as well as 
the nonoperating revenues and expenses. Annual state 
appropriations are classified as nonoperating revenues 
according to governmental accounting standards, even 
though the state-appropriated funds are used to support 
the operations of UAB. 

Without the nonoperating revenues, in particular the state 
appropriations and private gifts, UAB would not be able to 
cover its costs of operations. A summarized comparison 
of UAB’s revenues, expenses and changes in net position 
for the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018 
is presented below:

Operating revenues:
Gross  tuition  and  fees  revenue  increased by $10.2 
million and $17.1 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
Total student headcount of 22,080 and 21,923 increased 
by 157 or 0.7% in Fall 2019 and increased by 1,021 or 4.9% 
in Fall 2018. Gross tuition and fees revenue in 2020 and 
2019 is offset by scholarship allowances of $85.5 million 
and $80.2 million, respectively. 

UAB receives grant and contract revenue from federal, 
state, local governments and private agencies totaling 
$483.9, $494.0, and $461.6  million, a decrease of 2.0% 
from 2019 to 2020 and an increase of 7.0% from 2018 to 
2019, respectively.

Net hospital sales and service revenue totaled $2.11, 
$2.01, and $1.86 billion, an increase of 5.1% and 7.7% from 
2019 to 2020 and 2018 to 2019, respectively. These 
increases resulted from increased volume, contract 
improvements, and ongoing revenue-cycle improvement 
activities.

Net auxiliary sales and service revenue totaled $762.4, 
$715.7, and $690.4 million, an increase of 6.5% and 3.7% 
from 2019 to 2020 and 2018 to 2019, respectively. These 
increases resulted from Triton premium revenue growth 
offset by a decrease in University auxiliary revenues.   

Other sources:
Net educational sales and service revenue totaled $59.4, 
$67.6, and  $68.5  million, a decrease of 12.2% and 1.2% 
from 2019 to 2020 and 2018 to 2019, respectively. The 
current year decrease is due to a decline in clinical 
activity revenues.

Other operating revenue totaled $52.0, $76.8, and 
$65.5 million, a decrease of 32.3% from 2019 to 2020 and 
an increase of 17.3% from 2018 to 2019, respectively. The 
current year decrease is due to a decline in HSF support.

Nonoperating revenues:
UAB receives state educational appropriations and capital 
funding from the State of Alabama. UAB recognized 
educational appropriations and capital funding from the 
State of Alabama totaling $307.0, $287.7, and $273.4 
million, of which $297.7, $273.5, and $265.0 million was 
primarily from the Educational Trust Fund (ETF), which is 
included as nonoperating revenue.

Economic relief funds primarily consisted of the University 
Hospital receiving and recognizing $67.3 million in federal 
CARES Act provider relief funding and $3.2 million State 
CARES Act funding through September, 2020. 

Net investment income decreased $16.5 million from 2019 
to 2020 and decreased $57.9 million from 2018 to 2019. 
The decrease was a result of a decrease in the fair value 
of investments at the end of the year. 

UAB recognized $38, $77, and $59 million in gift revenue 
(composed partially of $18, $28, and $18 million and $1.9, 
$0.8, and $2.3  million in capital and endowment gifts, 
respectively) for the years ended September  30, 2020, 
2019, and 2018, respectively.

Operating Expenses
A comparative summary of UAB’s operating expenses for the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, is as 
follows:

2020 2019 2018

Salaries, wages, and benefits $ 1,766,044,825 $ 1,749,060,938 $ 1,674,990,688 

Supplies and services 2,001,552,207 1,846,254,490 1,734,410,959

Depreciation 150,994,130 148,344,143 146,686,513

Scholarships and fellowships 35,285,313 29,041,268 27,779,628

TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES $ 3,953,876,475 $ 3,772,700,839 $ 3,583,867,788 

Salaries, wages, and benefits increased $17.0  million or 
1.0% during 2020 and $74.1 million or 4.4% during 2019. 
These increases are primarily due to the growth of UAB’s 
salary base and rising benefit costs related to growth in 
salary base. Supplies and services expenses increased 
$155.3  million or 8.4% and $111.8  million or 6.4% during 
2020 and 2019, respectively. This increase is primarily 
attributable to UAB’s continued growth. In addition to 
natural classifications, operating expenses are reported 
by functional classifications as defined by the National 
Association of College and University Business Officers 
(“NACUBO”). 

The functional classification of an operating expense 
(Instruction, Research, etc.) is assigned to a department 
based on the nature of the activity, which represents the 
material portion of the activity attributable to the 
department. This method reflects, by function of UAB's, 
amounts expended in areas such as instruction, research, 
and operations and maintenance and is used most 
commonly for comparative reporting purposes among 
colleges and universities. Graphic illustrations of UAB’s 
operating expenses by function for the years ended 
September  30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, are 
presented as follows:

Economic Factors That Will Affect 
The Future
As a labor-intensive organization, UAB faces competitive 
pressures related to attracting and retaining faculty and 
staff.

The State of Alabama appropriates money each year to 
UAB for operating costs and nonoperating cash 
requirements, including capital expenditures. Because the 
State is mandated by its Constitution to operate with a 
balanced budget, the State occasionally has reduced its 
appropriations, through a process known as “proration,” 
when its annual revenues are not expected to meet 
budgeted appropriations. As the State could potentially 
implement proration in future years, UAB continues to 
implement cost-saving measures in order to minimize the 
impact of any future proration.

Private gifts are an important part of the fundamental 
support of UAB. Economic pressures affecting donors 
may also affect the future level of support UAB receives 
from corporate and individual giving. In fiscal year 2014, 
UAB launched its largest fundraising campaign to date 
known as “Give something change everything.” The 
fundraising goal of $1 billion was surpassed by UAB in 
November 2018, reaching it's stated goal of achieving the 
milestone by the end of 2018.

During fiscal year 2020, 67.6% of UAB students received 
financial aid, including $194.3 million of Federal Financial 
Aid. In recent years, financial aid reform and 
reauthorization of existing aid programs have been topics 
in legislative sessions. Management is monitoring 
proposed future legislation in order to respond in a 
manner to assist current and future students.

The Hospital faces significant challenges in a dynamic 
healthcare sector and volatile economic environment. The 
demand for health care services and the cost of providing 
them are increasing significantly while the revenues to 
support these services are diminishing. In addition to cost 
increases such as rising salary and benefit costs, the 
Hospital also faces additional costs associated with new 
technologies, the education and training of health care 
professionals and provision of care for a disproportionate 
share of the medically underserved in Alabama. In recent 
years, federal legislation has been enacted to slow future 
rate increases in Medicare and Medicaid and reduce 
medical education and disproportionate share funding. 
Management is committed to staying abreast of pertinent 
issues; implementing appropriate management actions 
and continuing to provide quality care for all patients.

In January 2020, the World Health Organization declared 
the novel Coronavirus ("COVID-19") a Public Health 
Emergency of International Concern. The outbreak of 
COVID-19 has caused domestic and global disruption in 
operations for institutions of higher education and 
healthcare organizations and has impacted several areas 
of UAB and University Hospital's financial statements as 
further discussed within Note 1.

These financial statements are prepared to provide a 
general overview of the University of Alabama at 
Birmingham and to demonstrate UAB’s accountability. 
Questions concerning any information provided in this 
report or requests for additional information should be

The University of Alabama at Birmingham 
Notes to Financial Statements

Years Ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 

(1)
Organization and 
Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies

The University of Alabama at Birmingham ("UAB") is one 
of three universities of The University of Alabama System 
("the System"), which is a component unit of the State of 
Alabama ("the State"). The financial statements of UAB are 
intended to present the financial position, changes in 
financial position, and the cash flows of only that portion 
of the business-type activities of the financial reporting 
entity of the System that is attributable to the transactions 
of UAB. They do not purport to, and do not, present fairly 
the financial position of the System, its changes in 
financial position or cash flows in accordance with 
accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America. The System is recognized as an 
organization exempt from Federal income tax under 
Section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code as an 
organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal 
Revenue Code.

UAB, as a public institution, prepares its financial 
statements in accordance with accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America, as 
prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards 
Board (GASB).

GASB Statement No. 35, Basic Financial Statements and 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis for Public 
Colleges and Universities, establishes standards for 
external financial reporting for public colleges and 
universities and requires that resources be classified for 
accounting and reporting purposes into the following 
three net position categories:

• Net Investment in Capital Assets:

Capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation and 
outstanding principal balances of debt attributable to the 
acquisition, construction, or improvement of those assets.

• Restricted:

Nonexpendable: Net position subject to externally 
imposed stipulations that they be maintained permanently 
by UAB. Such assets include UAB’s permanent 
endowment funds.

Expendable: Net position whose use by UAB is 
subject to externally imposed stipulations that can be 
fulfilled by actions of UAB pursuant to those stipulations 
or that expire by the passage of time.

• Unrestricted:

The net position that is not subject to externally imposed 
stipulations. Unrestricted net position may be designated 
for specific purposes by action of management. 
Substantially all of the unrestricted net position is 
designated for academic and research programs and 
initiatives and capital programs.

UAB reports as a business type activity, as defined by 
GASB Statement No. 35. Business type activities are 
those financed in whole or in part by fees charged to 
external parties for goods or services.

UAB policy states that operating activities as reported by 
the statement of revenues, expenses, and changes in net 
position are those that generally result from exchange 
transactions such as payments received for providing 
services and payments made for services or goods 
received. Certain significant revenue streams relied upon 
for operations are recorded as nonoperating revenues, as 
defined by GASB Statement No. 35.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with 
accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America, requires management to make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of 
contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the 
financial statements, and the reported amounts of 
revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. 
Actual results could differ from those estimates. The 
estimates susceptible to significant changes include those 
used in determining the allowance for contractual 
adjustments and uncollectible accounts, valuation of 
investments, accruals related to compensated absences, 
allowance for self-insurance, estimated amounts due to or 
from third-party payors, and reserves for general and 
professional liability claims. Although some variability is 
inherent in these estimates, management believes that 
the amounts provided are adequate.

Scope of Statements
UAB is principally comprised of a university ("the 
University") and the University of Alabama Hospital ("the 
Hospital" or "University Hospital") which are UAB’s 
reportable segments as defined by GASB Statement No. 
37, Basic Financial Statements and Management’s 
Discussion and Analysis-For State and Local 
Governments: Omnibus an Amendment of GASB 
Statements No. 21 and No. 34. UAB’s financial statements 
present the financial position, changes in financial 
position, and the cash flows of the University, the 
Hospital, and UAB’s blended component units. 
Condensed financial information of UAB’s reportable 

27



segments is presented at Note 15. Refer to Note 2 for 
information regarding UAB’s component units.

UAB is affiliated with the UAB Educational Foundation 
("UABEF"), the University of Alabama Health Services 
Foundation, P.C. ("HSF"), UAB Health System ("UABHS"), 
Medical West, Cooper Green Mercy Health Services 
Authority, and the Valley Foundation ("VF"). UAB is not 
financially accountable for UABEF, HSF, UABHS or VF; 
therefore, they do not constitute component units under 
the provisions of GASB Statement No. 14, The Financial 
Reporting Entity, as amended. These entities are not 
required to be presented as component units under 
GASB Statement No. 39, Determining Whether Certain 
Organizations are Component Units – an Amendment of 
GASB Statement No. 14 and No. 61, The Financial 
Reporting Entity – an Amendment of GASB Statement No. 
14 and 34. More information regarding HSF, UABHS and 
VF can be found at Note 16.

UABEF provides funds and certain facilities to UAB for its 
educational and scientific functions. UABEF has 13 board 
members, including seven outside members not affiliated 
with UAB. UABEF leases certain facilities to UAB, with 
rental expense of approximately $2.2 million for the year 
ended September 30, 2020 and $2.1 million for the year 
ended September 30, 2019. UABEF made contributions to 
UAB which totaled approximately $4.2 million for the year 
ended June 30, 2020 and approximately $4.6 million for 
the year ended June 30, 2019.

Implementation of new standards: During 2020, UAB 
adopted GASB Statement No. 89, Accounting for Interest 
Cost, which aims to enhance comparability of capital 
assets information and simplify accounting for interest 
cost incurred before the end of a construction period. The 
impact from its adoption of GASB 89 was not material to 
the financial statements.

Other significant accounting policies are as follows:

Cash and Cash Equivalents: For purposes of the 
statement of cash flows, UAB considers all highly liquid 
investments purchased with an original maturity of three 
months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents 
representing assets of UAB’s endowment, life income, 
and other long-term investments are included in 
noncurrent assets.

Investments: UAB’s investments are reported at fair 
value. The majority of UAB’s investment portfolio is 
invested in separate investment pools sponsored by the 
System. Fair value for the investment pools is provided by 
the System, based on the fair value of the underlying 
investment securities held by each investment pool. Fair 
value of the underlying securities held in each investment 
pool is based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes, 
where available, or determined using net asset values 
provided by underlying investment partnerships or 
companies. Fair value for equity securities, debt 
securities, mutual funds and U.S. government and agency 

obligations held by UAB is determined from quoted 
market prices or market prices of similar instruments. Real 
estate held as investments is reported at fair value based 
upon appraisals, acquisition value at the date of donation, 
and other valuations typically based on management 
assumptions or expectations. Investments received by gift 
are reported at fair value at date of receipt. Net 
investment income, including realized and unrealized 
gains and losses, is reported as nonoperating revenues 
(expenses) in the statements of revenues, expenses, and 
changes in net position.

Investments are reported in four categories in the 
statement of net position. Investments recorded as 
endowment and life income investments are those 
invested funds that cannot be used to fund current 
operations and thus are included in noncurrent assets. 
Investments held for future capital projects are included in 
noncurrent assets. Other long-term investments include 
amounts resulting from UAB’s equity investment in other 
entities, as discussed in Note 4 and Note 8. All other 
investments are included as short-term investments.

Inventories: Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or 
market. Inventories consist primarily of medical supplies 
and pharmaceuticals.

Accounts Receivable: Accounts receivable consist 
primarily of patient receivables, tuition charged to 
students and amounts due from federal, state, and local 
governments, or private sources, in connection with 
reimbursement of allowable expenditures made pursuant 
to UAB’s contracts and grants.

Capital Assets: All capital assets are carried at cost on 
date of acquisition (or in the case of gifts, at acquisition 
value on the date of donation), less accumulated 
depreciation (or in the case of assets leased under capital 
leases, net of accumulated amortization). UAB computes 
depreciation for buildings and building improvements 
(15-40 years) and for fixed equipment systems (3-20 
years) using a component method. Depreciation of land 
improvements (40 years), library collection (10 years), and 
inventoried equipment (3-20 years) is computed on a 
straight-line basis. The Hospital uses guidelines 
established by the American Hospital Association to 
assign useful lives to inventoried equipment.

Capital assets acquired under capital leases are 
amortized over the shorter of the lives of the respective 
leases or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Capital 
assets acquired through federal grants and contracts in 
which the Federal government retains a reversionary 
interest are capitalized and depreciated. 

Computer software capitalization, which is included as 
inventoried equipment, includes the costs of software and 
implementation. Implementation costs include consulting 
expenses and allocation of internal salaries and fringes 
for the core implementation team.

28



Pledges: UAB receives gift pledges and bequests of 
financial support. Revenue is recognized when a pledge 
representing an unconditional promise to give is received 
and all eligibility requirements, including time 
requirements, have been met. In the absence of such a 
promise, revenue is recognized when the gift is received. 
Pledges are recorded at their gross, undiscounted 
amount. Endowment pledges do not meet eligibility 
requirements and are not recorded as assets until the 
related gift is received in accordance with the 
requirements of GASB Statement No. 33, Accounting and 
Financial Reporting for Nonexchange Transactions. Due 
to uncertainties with regard to their realization and 
valuation, bequest intentions and other conditional 
promises are not recognized as assets until the specified 
conditions are met.

Endowment Spending: The State Legislature adopted the 
Alabama Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional 
Funds Act ("UPMIFA"), effective January 1, 2009, which 
permits the Board of Trustees of the University of 
Alabama (the “Board”) to appropriate an amount of 
realized and unrealized endowment appreciation as the 
Board determines to be prudent. UPMIFA prescribes 
guidelines for the expenditure of donor-restricted 
endowment funds in the absence of overriding, explicit 
donor stipulations. UPMIFA focuses on the entirety of a 
donor-restricted endowment fund, that is, both the 
original gift amount(s) and net appreciation. UPMIFA 
eliminates UMIFA’s historic-dollar-value threshold, an 
amount below which an organization could not spend 
from the fund, in favor of a more robust set of guidelines 
about what constitutes prudent spending, explicitly 
requiring consideration of the duration and preservation 
of the fund.

UAB’s policy is to retain the endowment realized and 
unrealized appreciation within an endowment after the 
spending rate distributions in a manner consistent with 
the standards of prudence prescribed by UPMIFA. The 
Board approved a spending rate for fiscal years 
September  30, 2020 and 2019 of 4.5%, based on a 
moving five-year average of the market (unit) value.

Prepaid Expenses and Unearned Scholarships: Prepaid 
expenses are composed of future expenses that have 
been paid in advance and include prepaid postage, travel, 
and other miscellaneous expenses. Unearned scholarship 
expense results from the Fall academic term spanning 
across the fiscal year-end. UAB prorates scholarship 
expense to recognize only the amounts incurred in each 
fiscal year.

Unearned Revenue: Unearned revenue consists primarily 
of student tuition and fees related predominantly to future 
fiscal years and amounts received from grant and contract 
sponsors that have not yet been earned under the terms 
of the agreements and, therefore, have not yet been 
included in the net position.

Federal Refundable Loans: Certain loans to students are 
administered by UAB with funding primarily supported by 
the federal government. UAB’s statements of net position 
include both the notes receivable and the related federal 
refundable loan liability representing federal capital 
contributions and related activity owed upon termination 
of the program. The Federal Perkins Loan Program 
expired June 30, 2018. The University will continue 
operating the program and remit any excess cash 
annually for the pro rata federal and institutional capital 
contributions. As of September  30, 2020, $1.4  million is 
payable to the Department of Education for its portion of 
the excess cash available at June 30, 2019.

Compensated Absences: UAB accrues annual leave for 
employees at rates based upon length of service and job 
classification. UAB accrues compensatory time based 
upon job classification and hours worked. These amounts 
are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.

Deferred Outflows of Resources: Deferred outflows of 
resources consist of bond deferred refunding amounts, 
pension obligations, and OPEB obligations (Trust and 
UAB Plan). Pension obligations include employer 
contributions to the Teachers’ Retirement System 
subsequent to the Plan’s measurement date, differences 
between expected and actual experience, and changes in 
actuarial and other assumptions. The Trust's obligations 
include employer contributions to the Alabama Retired 
Education Employees' Health Care Trust subsequent to 
the Trust's measurement date, differences between 
expected and actual experience, and changes in 
proportion and differences between employer 
contributions and proportionate share of contributions. 
The UAB Plan's obligations include employer 
contributions to the UAB Health Care Plan subsequent to 
the Plan's measurement date for eligible disabled retirees.

Deferred Inflows of Resources: Deferred inflows of 
resources are composed of bond deferred refunding 
amounts, pension obligations, and OPEB obligations 
(Trust and UAB Plan). Pension obligations include 
differences between expected and actual experience, 
changes in proportion and differences between employer 
contributions and proportionate share of contributions, 
and net difference between projected and actual earnings 
on pension plan investments. The Trust's obligations 
include changes in actuarial and other assumptions and 
net difference between projected and actual earnings on 
OPEB plan investments. The UAB Plan's obligations 
include differences between expected and actual 
experience and changes in actuarial and other 
assumptions.

Student Tuition and Fees and Scholarship Allowances 
and Student Aid: Student tuition and fees are presented 
net of scholarships and fellowships applied to student 
accounts, while stipends and other payments made 
directly to students are presented as scholarships and 
fellowships expense.

29



Grant and Contract Revenue: UAB receives grant and 
contract revenue from governmental and private sources. 
UAB recognizes revenue associated with the sponsored 
programs in accordance with GASB Statement No. 33, 
based on the terms of the individual grant or contract.

Hospital Revenue: Net patient service revenue is 
reported at the Hospital’s estimated net realizable 
amounts from patients, third-party payors, and others for 
services rendered, including estimated retroactive 
revenue adjustments due to revenue audits, reviews, and 
investigations. Retroactive adjustments are considered in 
the recognition of revenue on an estimated basis in the 
period the related services are rendered.

The Hospital provides care to patients who meet certain 
criteria under its charity care policy without charge or at 
amounts less than its estimated rates. Because the 
Hospital does not pursue collection of amounts 
determined to qualify as charity care, they are not 
reported as revenue.

Auxiliary Enterprise Revenue: Auxiliary enterprise 
revenues primarily represent revenues generated by 
intercollegiate athletics and parking as well as subscriber 
premiums for Triton Health Systems, L.L.C.

Other Revenue: Other revenue represents primarily 
revenues generated by UAB for activities such as 
intellectual property income and the University of 
Alabama Health Services Foundation, P.C. ("HSF") 
transfers.

Equity Investments: Investments in affiliated companies 
where UAB can exercise significant influence and for 
which UAB’s ownership interest is 50% or less are 
accounted for using the equity method. The investment in 
the Professional Liability Trust Fund ("PLTF") also is 
accounted for using the equity method. See Notes 4 and 
8.

Nonoperating Revenues (Expenses): Nonoperating 
revenues and expenses include State educational 
appropriations, federal appropriations, Federal Pell grants, 
private gifts for other than capital purposes, investment 
income, net unrealized appreciation or depreciation in the 
fair value of investments, interest expense, loss on asset 
dispositions, and for fiscal year 2020 CARES Act funds.

COVID-19 Pandemic: In January 2020, the World Health 
Organization declared the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) a 
Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The 
outbreak of COVID-19 has caused domestic and global 
disruption in operations for institutions of higher 
education and healthcare organizations. The outbreak 
has also negatively impacted both the global financial 
markets and UAB’s investments, including the 
investments held within the System Pools, and may 
continue to do so. Other adverse consequences of 
COVID-19 in the future may include, but are not limited to, 
decline in enrollment, decline in demand for University 
housing, decline in demand for University programs that 

involve travel, and additional volatility within UAB’s 
investments. UAB believes it has sufficient liquidity to 
meet its operating and financing needs; however, given 
the difficulty in predicting the ultimate duration and 
severity of the impact of COVID-19 on UAB, the economy 
and the financial markets, the ultimate impact is unknown 
and cannot be reasonably quantified at this time.

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security 
(“CARES”) Act: The CARES Act was signed into law in 
March 2020 in order to provide economic assistance for 
businesses and individuals that have been negatively 
impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. During 2020, the 
University received payments primarily from two CARES 
Act programs, the Higher Education Emergency Relief 
Fund ("HEERF") and the Coronavirus Relief Fund ("CRF") 
which are included in nonoperating grants in the 
accompanying statements of revenues, expenses and 
changes in net position. The Higher Education Emergency 
Relief Fund is administered through the U.S. Department 
of Education and was designed to facilitate the 
distribution of emergency financial aid grants directly to 
students, as well as to provide funding for institutions 
negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Under 
the terms of the student portion of this program, revenue 
is recognized once eligible expenditures associated with 
the distribution of aid to students have been incurred. For 
the institutional portions of this program, revenue is 
recognized as UAB identifies eligible expenditures or lost 
revenues which qualify for reimbursement. Revenue 
recognized from the HEERF totaled $6.1 million student 
aid relief and $5.0 million institutional relief. The 
Coronavirus Relief Fund is administered through the State 
of Alabama Department of Finance. The purpose of the 
Coronavirus Relief Fund appropriation is for the funds to 
be used to prevent, prepare for, and respond to 
coronavirus only. The CRF covers only those costs that 
are necessary expenditures incurred due to the public 
health emergency with respect to COVID-19. Eligibility to 
receive payment from the State’s portion of funds from 
the CRF is contingent upon certifying that UAB will: (1) use 
the funds in a lawful manner consistent with Section 
601(d) of the Coronavirus Relief Fund and (2) will comply 
with any and all policies and directives issued by the 
Alabama Department of Finance related to the 
Coronavirus Relief Funds. At September  30, 2020. UAB 
was awarded $37.0 million of CRF funds to assist with 
state testing and exposure notifications, including a $6.0 
million advance payment. At September  30, 2020, UAB 
had recognized $5.4 million of revenue for actual 
expenses incurred.

University Hospital received and recognized $67.3 million 
in federal CARES Act provider relief funding through 
September, 2020 and recognized and recorded a 
receivable for $3.2 million in CARES funds allocated from 
the State of Alabama.  

In addition, University Hospital received $180.2 million in 
advanced payments from the Centers for Medicare and 

30



Medicaid Services ("CMS") Accelerated and Advanced 
Payments Program reported as due to third party payors 
and advances payable, net on the Statements of Net 
Position. The Medicare advance payment amount is 
classified as a current liability based on guidance as of 
September  30, 2020, however guidance issued 
subsequent to September 30, 2020 provides for the 
advance payments to be repaid over a period extending 
beyond 12 months. 

(2) Component Unit(s)
GASB Statement No. 14, The Financial Reporting Entity, as 
amended by GASB Statement No. 39, Determining 
Whether Certain Organizations are Component Units – 
an Amendment of GASB Statement No. 14, No. 61, The 
Financial Reporting Entity – an Amendment of GASB 
Statement No. 14 and 34 and No. 80, Blending 
Requirements for Certain Component Units – an 
amendment of GASB Statement No. 14, requires 
governmental entities to include in their financial 
statements as a component unit, organizations that are 
legally separate entities for which the governmental 
entity, as a primary organization, is financially 
accountable. The primary objective of these statements is 
to determine whether all entities associated with a 
primary government are potential component units and 
should be evaluated for inclusion in the financial reporting 
entity. The statements as amended provide additional 
guidance to determine whether certain organizations for 
which the primary government is not financially 
accountable should be reported as component units 
based on the nature and significance of their relationship 
with the primary government.

The by-laws and corporate charter of the Southern 
Research Institute (SRI) allow UAB to appoint a majority of 
the board of directors. Management has determined that 
SRI is a discretely presented component unit of UAB 
under GASB Statements No. 14 and No. 61. SRI reports 
financial results under principles prescribed under the 
GASB. SRI offers research and technology services to 
support industry and federal government agencies 
primarily in the areas of drug design and evaluation, 
environmental controls, materials engineering, and 
chemical and biological defense. The activities of SRI are 
maintained using a fiscal calendar year-end that ends 
prior to UAB’s fiscal year-end of September 30. The 
financial results of SRI are discretely presented in  these 
financial statements.

UAB includes five blended component units, as follows: 
UAB Research Foundation ("UABRF"), UAB Athletics 
Foundation ("UABAF"), Alabama Care Plan ("ACP"), UAB 
Hospital Management, L.L.C. ("LLC") and Triton Health 
Systems, L.L.C. ("Triton"). The by-laws and corporate 

charters of UABRF allow UAB to appoint a majority of the 
board of directors and allow UAB to impose its will on the 
entity. UABRF operates for the exclusive benefit of UAB.  
UABAF was organized to support the UAB Athletics 
Department in its quest for excellence in all programs. 
UABAF operates as an extension of the UAB Athletics 
Department and it almost exclusively benefits the 
University. The by-laws of ACP allow UAB to appoint a 
majority of the members of the Member Board, as 
defined, which operates in a consultory capacity with the 
ACP Board of Directors. The by-laws allow the ACP 
Member Board certain operational and financial 
protective rights. Additionally, LLC and Triton have 
governing bodies that are substantively the same as the 
governing body of UAB and there is a financial benefit or 
burden relationship between UAB and these entities. 
Therefore, management has determined that UABRF, 
UABAF, ACP, LLC and Triton (the Blended Component 
Units) constitute blended component units of UAB under 
GASB Statements No. 14 and No. 61. The Blended 
Component Units report financial results under principles 
prescribed under the GASB.

UABRF was organized exclusively for charitable, scientific, 
and educational purposes in order to benefit UAB. UABAF 
was formed in November 2015 as a nonprofit corporation 
organized to build loyalty and philanthropic support for 
the UAB athletic program and support the staff in 
coordinating, developing and improving a superior inter-
collegiate athletics program. UABAF encourages alumni 
and friends to generously support the Athletics 
Department and contribute to scholarship funding for 
UAB’s student athletes. ACP was formed in September 
2014 to apply to become certified by the Alabama 
Medicaid Agency as a probationary regional care 
organization ("RCO"), with the goal at the time of being 
eligible to become a fully certified RCO by July 1, 2017. 
Effective October 17, 2016, ACP resolved to cease its 
pursuit of full regional care organization certification from 
the Alabama Medicaid Agency and cease efforts to enter 
into a risk contract with Medicaid to provide RCO services 
to Medicaid beneficiaries. On July 27, 2017, the Alabama 
Medicaid Agency abandoned its development of regional 
care organizations. The current Alabama Medicaid Health 
Home program  ended on September 30, 2019 and  the 
new Medicaid program Alabama Coordinated Health 
Network (ACHN), began October 1, 2019.  ACP’s members 
are the University Hospital, St. Vincent’s Health System 
and Triton. Effective September 28, 2020, ACP was 
dissolved. The LLC was organized for the exclusive 
purpose of supporting UAB in connection with the 
management, administration, and operation of the 
University Hospital, including, without limitation, providing 
management, administrative, and staffing services to the 
University Hospital. Triton was formed to advance the 
educational and research mission of UAB and to educate 
and train physicians and other health care professionals. 
Triton is owned 99% by UAB and 1% by The UABEF. 

31



UABRF, ACP and LLC maintain a September 30 year-end. 
UABAF maintains a June 30 year-end. The activities of 
Triton are maintained using a fiscal calendar year-end that 
ends prior to UAB’s fiscal year-end of September 30. 
However, interfund cash transactions during the period 

from January 1 through September 30 have been 
eliminated. Since Triton qualifies as a major component 
unit under GASB Statement No. 61, financial information 
for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 is 
presented on the subsequent page.

(3) Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Board approves, by resolution, all banks or other 
financial institutions utilized as depositories for UAB 
funds. Prior to approval, each proposed depository must 
provide evidence of its designation by the Alabama state 
treasurer as a qualified public depository under the 
Security for Alabama Funds Enhancement Act (SAFE). 
From time to time, the Board may request that the 
depository provide evidence of its continuing designation 
as a qualified public depository. In the past, the bank 
pledged collateral directly to each individual public entity. 
Under the mandatory SAFE program, each qualified 
public depository (QPD) is required to hold collateral for 
all its public deposits on a pooled basis in a custody 
account established for the State Treasurer as SAFE 
administrator. In the unlikely event a public entity should 
suffer a deposit loss due to QPD insolvency or default, a 
claim form would be filed with the state treasurer, who 
would use the SAFE pool collateral or other means to 
reimburse the loss. As of September 30, 2020 and 2019, 
respectively, UAB had cash and cash equivalents totaling   
$705.3 million and $522.5 million

(4) Investments
The Board has the responsibility for the establishment of 
the investment policy and the oversight of the 
investments for the System and related entities. In order 
to facilitate System-wide investment objectives and 
achieve economies of scale, the Board previously 
established three distinct investment pools based 
primarily on the projected investment time-horizons for 
System funds: the Pooled Endowment Fund ("PEF"), Long 
Term Reserve Pool Fund ("LTRP") and the Short Term 
Liquidity Pool Fund ("STLP"); collectively, the “System 
Pools”. In April 2020, the Board approved a merger of the 
STLP and the LTRP into one pool, the Liquidity and 
Capital Reserve Pool (“LCRP”). In July 2020, the Board 
closed the STLP and transferred the assets to the LTRP to 
create the new merged pool, with a new asset allocation. 
Pursuant to Board investment policies, each System or 
related entity may include all or a portion of their 
investments within the System sponsored investment 
pools. These investment funds are considered ‘internal’ 
investment pools under GASB Statement No. 31, 
Accounting and Financial Reporting for Certain 
Investments and for External Investment Pools with the 
assets pooled on a market value basis. Separately 
managed funds that reside with each entity are to be 

invested consistent with the asset mix of the 
corresponding System investment pool. UAB applies the 
same investment policies for separately held investments 
as those of the System Pools.

The following disclosures relate to both the System Pools, 
which include the investments of other System entities 
and other affiliated entities, and the UAB-specific 
investment portfolio.

Pooled Endowment Fund
The purpose of the PEF is to pool endowment and similar 
funds to support the System universities, Hospital and 
related entities in carrying out their respective missions 
over a perpetual time frame. Accordingly, the primary 
investment objectives of the PEF are to preserve the 
purchasing power of the principal and provide a stable 
source of perpetual financial support to the endowment 
beneficiaries. To satisfy the long-term rate of return 
objective, the PEF relies on a total return strategy in which 
investment returns are achieved through both capital 
appreciation and natural income. Asset allocation targets 
are established to meet return objectives while providing 
adequate diversification in order to minimize investment 
volatility.

Long Term Reserve Pool Fund (effective July 1, 2020, 
merger with the STLP to form the LCRP)
The LTRP was a longer-term pool used as an investment 
vehicle to manage operating reserves with a time horizon 
of three to seven years. This fund had an investment 
objective of growth and income and was invested in a 
diversified asset mix of liquid, semi-liquid and illiquid 
securities. This fund can invest no more than 10% in 
illiquid assets.

Short Term Liquidity Pool Fund (effective July 1, 2020, 
merger with the LTRP to form the LCRP)
The STLP served as an investment vehicle to manage 
operating reserves with a time horizon of one to three 
years. This fund was also used to balance the other funds 
when looking at the System’s entire asset allocation of 
operating reserves relative to its investment objectives. 
The STLP had an investment objective of income with 
preservation of capital and is invested in intermediate 
term fixed income securities. The fund held at least one 
large mutual fund to provide daily liquidity.

Liquidity and Capital Reserve Pool
The LCRP serves as an investment vehicle to manage 
operating reserves of the System universities, hospital, 
and related entities with an investment strategy that 
matches the duration of reserves to their projected needs.  
The goals of the pool are to preserve and grow capital, 
maximize returns without undue exposure to risk, and 
maintain sufficient liquidity for credit ratings.  The pool is 
invested in a diversified asset mix of liquid, semi-liquid, 
and illiquid securities.  The pool can invest no more than 
15% in illiquid assets and must invest no less than 60% in 
liquid assets as defined by Board Rule 404.

Fair Value Measurements
GASB 72 sets forth the framework for measuring fair 
value. That framework provides a fair value hierarchy that 
prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to 
measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest 
priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for 
identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and 
the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 
measurements). The three levels of the fair value 
hierarchy under GASB 72 are described as follows:

• Level 1 – Inputs to the valuation methodology are 
unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities 
in active markets that UAB has the ability to access.

• Level 2 – Inputs to the valuation methodology 
include:

• Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in 
active markets;

• Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or 
liabilities in inactive markets;

• Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable 
for the assets or liabilities;

• Inputs that are derived principally from or 
corroborated by observable market data by 
correlation or other means.

• Level 3 – Inputs to the valuation methodology are 
unobservable and significant to the fair value 
measurement. Unobservable inputs reflect UAB’s own 
assumptions about the inputs market participants would 
use in pricing the asset or liability (including assumptions 
about risk). Unobservable inputs are developed based on 
the best information available in the circumstances and 
may include UAB’s own data.

GASB 72 allows for the use of net asset value ("NAV") as a 
practical expedient for valuation purposes for investment 
that do not have readily determinable fair value. 
Investments that use NAV in determining fair value are 
disclosed separately from the valuation hierarchy as 
presented herein.

The level within the hierarchy is based on the lowest level 
of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 
Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of 
observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable 
inputs.

The determination of what constitutes observable 
requires judgment by UAB’s management. UAB 
management considers observable data to be that market 
data which is readily available, regularly distributed or 
updated, reliable, and verifiable, not proprietary, and 
provided by multiple independent sources that are 
actively involved in the relevant market.

The categorization of an investment within the hierarchy 
is based upon the relative observability of the inputs to its 
fair value measurement and does not necessarily 
correspond to UAB management’s perceived risk of that 
investment.

The following is a description of the valuation methods 
and assumptions used by UAB to estimate the fair value 
of its investments. There have been no changes in the 
methods and assumptions used at September 30, 2020. 
The methods described may produce a fair value 
calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable 
value or reflective of future fair values. UAB management 
believes its valuation methods are appropriate and 
consistent with other market participants. The use of 
different methodologies or assumptions to determine the 
fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a 
different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

When available, quoted prices are used to determine fair 
value. When quoted prices in active markets are available, 
investments are classified within Level 1 of the fair value 
hierarchy. UAB’s Level 1 investments primarily consist of 
investments in mutual funds, exchange traded funds, and 
both domestic and foreign equity funds. When quoted 
prices in active markets are not available, fair values are 
based on evaluated prices received from UAB’s custodian 
of investments.

UAB’s Level 2 investments consist of mutual funds that 
are priced or traded at the end of the day.

UAB’s Level 3 investments primarily consist of very illiquid 
securities. The inputs or methodologies used for valuing 
securities are not necessarily an indication of the risks 
associated with investing in those securities. Changes in 
valuation techniques may result in transfers into or out of 
an assigned level within the disclosure hierarchy. 
Valuation techniques utilized by UAB are appraisals, entry 
price at the date of donation, and other valuations 
typically based on management assumptions or 
expectations.

Investment Risk Factors
There are many factors that can affect the value of 
investments. Some, such as custodial credit risk, 
concentration of credit risk and foreign currency risk, may 
affect both equity and fixed income securities. Equity 
securities respond to such factors as economic 
conditions, individual company earnings performance and 
market liquidity, while fixed income securities are 
particularly sensitive to credit risks and changes in 
interest rates.

Credit Risk
Fixed income securities are subject to credit risk, which is 
the chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or 
principal in a timely manner, or that negative perceptions 
of the issuer’s ability to make these payments will cause 
security prices to decline. These circumstances may arise 
due to a variety of factors such as financial weakness, 
bankruptcy, litigation, and/or adverse political develop-
ments. Certain fixed income securities, primarily 

obligations of the U.S. government or those explicitly 
guaranteed by the U.S. government, are not considered 
to have significant credit risk.

The investment policy recognizes that credit risk is 
appropriate in balanced investment pools such as the PEF 
and and LCRP, and the credit quality of underlying fund 
investments is monitored on an ongoing basis. Fixed 
income investments within the PEF and LCRP include 
corporate, mortgage backed, asset backed, collateralized 
mortgage and U.S. treasury and/or agency bonds. In 
addition, approximately $202.6  million and $39.4  million 
in the PEF and LTRP (2019)/LCRP (2020), collectively, at 
September  30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, is invested 
in unrated fixed income securities, excluding fixed income 
commingled funds. Fixed income commingled funds and 
money market funds were approximately $509.2  million 
and $299.5  million in the PEF and LTRP (2019)/LCRP 
(2020), collectively, at September  30, 2020 and 2019, 
respectively.

41



The STLP fixed income investments included corporate, 
mortgage backed, asset backed, collateralized mortgage 
and U.S. treasury and/or agency bonds. For 
September  30, 2019, approximately $173.2  million was 
invested by the STLP in unrated fixed income securities, 
excluding commingled bond funds, and money market 

funds. Fixed income commingled funds totaled 
approximately $263.1 million at September 30, 2019.

The credit risk for fixed and variable income securities, for 
the System Pools, at September 30, 2020 and 2019 is as 
follows:

In accordance with the Board policy disclosed previously, 
credit risk for UAB's fixed and variable income securities 
held outside of the System Pools is managed by 
diversifying across issuers and limiting the amount of 
portfolio assets that are invested in non- investment grade 
securities.

The credit risk for fixed and variable income securities of 
UAB’s separately held investments at September  30, 
2020 and 2019 is as follows:

Custodial Credit Risk
Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the event of the 
corporate failure of the custodian, the investment 
securities may not be returned.

Investment securities in the System Pools and UAB’s 
separately held investments are registered in the Board’s 
name by the custodial bank as an agent for the System. 
Other types of investments (e.g. open-ended mutual 
funds, money market funds) represent ownership 
interests that do not exist in physical or book-entry form. 
As a result, custodial credit risk is remote.

Concentration of Credit Risk
Concentration of credit risk is the risk associated with a 
lack of diversification, such as having substantial 
investments in a few individual issuers, thereby exposing 
the organization to greater risks resulting from adverse 
economic, political, regulatory, geographic, or credit 
developments.

As previously mentioned, credit risk in each investment 
pool and UAB’s separately held portfolio is managed 
primarily by diversifying across issuers and limiting the 
amount of portfolio assets that can be invested in non-
investment grade securities. 

As of September  30, 2020 and 2019, there was no 
investment in a single issuer that represents 5% or more 
of total investments held by any single investment 
manager of the System Pools or UAB’s separately held 
investment portfolio except for investments issued by the 
U.S. government and money market fund investments.

Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of fixed income 
securities will decline because of changing interest rates. 
The prices of fixed income securities with a longer time to 
maturity, measured by effective duration, tend to be more 
sensitive to changes in interest rates and, therefore, more 
volatile than those with shorter durations. Effective 
duration is the approximate change in price of a security 
resulting from a 100 basis point (1 percentage point) 
change in the level of interest rates. It is not a measure of 
time. 

The Board does not have a specific policy relative to 
interest rate risk. As such, there are no restrictions on 
weighted average maturity for each investment pool as 
they are managed relative to the investment objectives 
and liquidity demands of the investors. 

The effective durations in years for fixed or variable 
income securities, for the System Pools at September 30, 
2020 and 2019 are as follows:

POOLED ENDOWMENT FUND LCRP FUND LRTP FUND STLP FUND

2020 2019 2020 2019 2019

U.S. Government Obligations 11.9 9.2 3.4 9.2 2.1

Corporate Bonds 7.3 6.3 3.0 6.3 1.8

Non-US Bonds 7.3 6.3 3.0 6.3 1.8

Commingled Bond Funds 3.3 3.6 2.9 2.0 2.7

Investments may also include mortgage pass through 
securities and collateralized mortgage obligations that 
may be considered to be highly sensitive to changes in 
interest rates due to the existence of prepayment or 
conversion features. 

At September 30, 2020 and 2019, the fair market values 
of these investments in the System Pools are as follows:

POOLED ENDOWMENT FUND LCRP FUND LRTP FUND STLP FUND

2020 2019 2020 2019 2019

Mortgage Backed Securities $ 13,435,270 $ 16,998,880 $ 253,871,960 $ 28,505,448 $ 256,770,944 

Collateralized Mortgage Obligations  —  —  22,981,714  —  18,530,989 

TOTAL FIXED $ 13,435,270 $ 16,998,880 $ 276,853,674 $ 28,505,448 $ 275,301,933 

Mortgage Backed Securities. These securities are issued 
by the Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie 
Mae"), Government National Mortgage Association 
("Ginnie Mae") and Federal Home Loan Mortgage 
Association ("Freddie Mac") and include short embedded 
prepayment options. Unanticipated prepayments by the 

obligees of the underlying asset reduce the total 
expected rate of return.

43



Collateralized Mortgage Obligations. Collateralized 
mortgage obligations ("CMOs") generate a return based 
upon either the payment of interest or principal on 
mortgages in an underlying pool. The relationship 
between interest rates and prepayments makes the fair 

value highly sensitive to changes in interest rates. In 
falling interest rate environments, the underlying 
mortgages are subject to a higher propensity of 
prepayments. In a rising interest rate environment, the 
opposite is true.

At September 30, 2020 and 2019, the effective durations for these securities held in the System Pools are as follows:

POOLED ENDOWMENT FUND LCRP FUND LRTP FUND STLP FUND

Mortgage Backed Securities 2.9 3.6 2.0 3.7 1.5

Collateralized Mortgage 
Obligations

— — 2.6 — 1.7

There are no mortgage backed securities or CMOs in 
UAB’s separately held investments at September  30, 
2020 and 2019.

Foreign Currency Risk
The strategic asset allocation policy for the PEF, the 
LCRP, and UAB’s separately held investments includes an 
allocation to non-United States equity and fixed income 
securities. Currency hedging of foreign bonds and stocks 
is allowed under System policy. As of September  30, 
2020 and 2019, all foreign investments in the System 
Pools and UAB’s separately held investments are 
denominated in U.S. dollars and are in international 
commingled funds, which in turn invest in equity securities 
and bonds of foreign issuers except for foreign stock and 
non-U.S. bond funds denominated in U.S. dollars and held 
by each of the three pools as disclosed in previous tables.

Securities Lending
The System permits security lending as a mechanism to 
augment income. Loans of the securities are required to 
be collateralized by cash, letters of credit or securities 
issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government or its 
agencies. The collateral must equal at least 102% of the 
current market value of the loaned securities. Securities 
lending contracts must state acceptable collateral for 
securities loaned, duties of the borrower, delivery of 
loaned securities and acceptable investment of the 
collateral. At September 30, 2020 and 2019, there were 
no securities on loan from the investment pools.

Joint Ventures
UAB accounts for its ownership of the PLTF as a joint 
venture, using the equity method in the amount of 
approximately $59.9  million and $60.3  million at 
September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. See Note 8 
for further discussion of the PLTF.

(5) Receivables
Account receivable:
Accounts receivable consist of patient receivables, tuition 
charged to students and amounts due from federal, state 
and local governments, or private sources, in connection 
with reimbursement of allowable expenditures made 
pursuant to UAB’s contracts and grants. 

The composition of accounts receivable at September 30, 
2020 and 2019 is summarized as follows:

2020 2019

Patient care $ 473,302,106 $ 397,838,014

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET $ 565,381,018 $ 481,727,985 

44



Loans receivable:
Loans receivable represent all amounts owed on 
promissory notes from debtors, including student loans 
made under the Federal Perkins Loan Program and other 
loan programs. The principal repayment and interest rate 
terms of federal and university loans vary considerably. 
The allowance for doubtful accounts only applies to 
University-funded notes and the University portion of 
federal student loans, since the University is not obligated 
to fund the federal portion of uncollected student loans. 
Federal loan programs are funded principally with federal 
advances to UAB under the Perkins and various health 
professions loan programs.

The composition of loans receivable at September  30, 
2020 and 2019 is summarized in the  table as follows:.

2020 2019

Federal loan program  12,307,521  13,928,150 

University loan funds  2,306,822  2,348,143

TOTAL LOANS RECEIVABLE OUTSTANDING, 
NONCURRENT $ 8,347,250 $ 10,980,614 

Pledges receivable:
Pledges receivable represent unconditional promises to 
give from third party donors. Pledges for permanent 
endowments do not meet eligibility requirements, as 
defined by GASB Statement No. 33, until the related gift is 
received. Due to uncertainties with regard to their 
realization and valuation, bequest intentions and other 
conditional promises are not recognized as assets until 
the specified conditions are met. 

The composition of pledges receivable at September 30, 
2020 and 2019 is summarized in the following table.

2020 2019

Operations $ 29,874,012 $ 52,842,041

The University defeased certain indebtedness during 
fiscal year 2020 with the 2019 Series C and D bond 
issuance. For this defeasance, funds were deposited in 
escrow trust accounts sufficient to provide for the 
subsequent payment of principal and interest on the 
defeased indebtedness. Under the trust agreements, 
funds deposited in the trust accounts were invested in 

obligations of the U.S. Government. The University 
estimates that the amounts on deposit will be sufficient to 
satisfy the debt service requirements on the defeased 
indebtedness and that the defeasance will result in lower 
overall debt service payments to the University. Should 
the amounts on deposit not be sufficient to retire the 
defeased indebtedness upon maturity, the University 

50



would be responsible to satisfy the shortfall. The 
University remains legally obligated for the repayment of 
the defeased indebtedness. Neither the assets of the trust 
accounts nor the defeased indebtedness are included in 
the accompanying statements of net position. The 
principal outstanding on the 2019 defeased indebtedness 
at September 30, 2020 is approximately $75.5 million.

The undiscounted cash flows required to service principal 
and interest under the old bonds as of September  30, 
2020, would have been $115.7  million compared to 
undiscounted cash flow requirements of $105.1  million 
under the new bonds. The economic gain to the 
University of the bond refinancing in fiscal year 2020 was 
calculated to be approximately $8.3  million using an 
effective interest rate of approximately 2.4% applied to 
the old and new bond cash flow requirements.

In November 2019, the University issued $39.8 million 
and $35.7 million in Series 2019C and Series 2019D 
General Revenue Bonds, respectively. The bonds pay 
interest at varying rates of 3.0% to 5.0% and 2.15% to 
4.0%, respectively, with principal due annually through 
October 1, 2041. The proceeds of these offering are being 
used for the purposes of advance refunding Series 
2010A, 2010B, and 2010C General Revenue Bonds; and 
paying costs and expenses associated with this issue. 
These bonds were issued at a premium of $5.8 million 
resulting in total proceeds of $81.4 million.

In June 2019, the University issued $24.8 million in Series 
2019A General Revenue Bonds. The bonds pay interest at 
a rate of 4.00% with principal due annually through 
October 1, 2029. In June 2019, the University issued 
$145.9 million in Series 2019B General Revenue Bonds, 
$75.1 million of which was in the form of Serial Bonds and 
$71.9 million of which was in the form of Term Bonds. The 
bonds pay interest at varying rates of 3.0% to 5.0% with 
principal due annually through October 1, 2041 and 
October 1, 2048, respectively. The proceeds of both the 
Series 2019A and 2019B bonds will be used for the 
purposes of financing a portion of the cost of certain 
capital improvements to the UAB campus, as well as 
paying costs and expenses associated with this issue. 
These bonds were issued at a premium of $16.4 million 
resulting in total cash received of $187.1 million.

In June 2019, The UAB Medicine Finance Authority issued 
$8.1 million in Series 2019A Revenue Bonds and $103.4 
million in Series 2019B Revenue Bonds, the proceeds of 
which were loaned to UAB Health System pursuant to 
Series 2019A and Series 2019B loan agreements. 
Concurrently, the Hospital entered into a loan agreement 
with UAB Health System to borrow $77.0 million of the 
2019A and 2019B bond proceeds for the purpose of 
financing capital improvement projects. Of this $77.0 
million, $11 million was distributed to the Hospital as of 
September 30, 2020. As the Hospital is legally obligated 
to repay $77.0 million and is currently paying principal 
and interest on this full amount, The Hospital has 

reflected the full $77.0 million on its statement of net 
position as long-term debt and $34.5 million as Due from 
UAB Health System which is classified as Due from 
affiliate on the statement of net position. the Hospital pays 
interest to UAB Health System on the entire amount 
borrowed, regardless of the amount outstanding. There 
are no financial covenants related to the loan between 
the Hospital and UAB Health System. 

The UAB general revenue bonds and the Hospital 
Revenue Trust Indentures are subject to certain 
covenants with the most restrictive being those on the 
Hospital’s 2012A series issuance. These covenants, 
among other things, require the Hospital to ensure 
pledged revenues are sufficient for debt service coverage 
by a ratio of 1.1 times. UAB and the Hospital are in 
compliance with all financial covenants as of 
September 30, 2020.

The UAB Medicine Financing Authority’s Revenue Trust 
Indentures are also subject to certain covenants. These 
covenants require the obligated group to ensure pledged 
revenues are sufficient for debt service coverage by a 
ratio of 1.1 times. The obligated group is in compliance 
with all financial covenants as of September 30, 2020

(8) Self-Insurance
UAB manages risks related to medical malpractice, 
general liability, and employee health care through a 
combination of self-insurance, risk pooling arrangements, 
and commercial insurance coverage.

UAB’s medical malpractice liability is managed by PLTF, a 
professional liability trust fund. PLTF functions as a risk-
sharing vehicle for UAB and more than ten 
nongovernmental organizations. PLTF covers liabilities of 
the covered parties, including UAB, arising from reported 
claims, claims that are incurred but not reported, and 
future costs of handling these claims. The liabilities are 
generally based on present value actuarial valuations 
discounted using interest rates from 2% to 5%. The 
discount rate used in both 2020 and 2019 was 2%. The 
associated risks of claims are subject to aggregate limits, 
with excess liability coverage provided by independent 
insurers to protect participants against losses should a 
claim arise that exceeds PLTF coverage limits. Although 
UAB is the sponsor of PLTF, it is not the predominant 
participant in the fund.

The PLTF’s policy committee establishes the premium 
rate of participants based on recommendations from 
consulting actuaries and considering the assumption of 
risk from the PLTF’s date of inception. Premiums paid to 
the PLTF are provided by UAB, HSF, and other 
participants. In addition, certain legal and administrative 

51



services are provided to the PLTF by the University of 
Alabama System.

The PLTF agreement requires 10% of all PLTF assets to be 
held in liquid assets. At September  30, 2020 and 2019, 
the liquid assets of the PLTF, as defined by the 
agreement, were in compliance with the agreement.

As discussed in Note 4, UAB accounts for its ownership of 
the PLTF under the equity method of accounting and it is 
not included in the table below.

General liability is subject to various claims and aggregate 
limits, with excess liability coverage provided by an 
independent insurer. General liability and employee 
health care claims and expenses are reported when it is 
probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of the 
loss can be reasonably estimated. Those losses include 
an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not 
reported and the future costs of handling claims. The  
liabilities are based on actuarial valuations and are 
reported at present value. The discount rate used for the 
general liability was 2% in both 2020 and 2019.

Changes in the total self-insured liabilities for the years 
ended September  30, 2020 and 2019 are presented as 
follows for UAB:

SELF INSURED LIABILITIES 2020 2019

Balance, beginning of year $ 7,669,735 $ 10,412,292 

Claims incurred and changes in 
estimates $ 62,939,205 $ 64,012,041 

Claim payments $ (62,843,179) $ (66,754,598) 

BALANCE, END OF YEAR $ 7,765,761 $ 7,669,735 

(9) Employee Benefits
Eligible employees of the University and Hospital 
participate in the mandatory Teachers’ Retirement System 
of Alabama (“TRS”), a cost sharing, multiple-employer 
public retirement system designated as a defined benefit 
plan. In addition, eligible employees may elect to 
participate in a voluntary 403(b) defined contribution 
retirement plan.  Prior to fiscal year 2020, the plan offered 
to eligible employees a choice between two 
recordkeepers, Teachers Insurance and Annuity 
Association (“TIAA”) and the Variable Annuity Life 
Insurance Company (“VALIC”).  Effective in fiscal year 
2020, the System, in conjunction with its participating 
universities and with the Board’s approval, transitioned to 
a single recordkeeper with TIAA serving as sole-vendor 
for the plan.

Defined Benefit Plan - TRS
Plan Description. The Teachers’ Retirement System of 
Alabama, a cost-sharing multiple-employer public 

employee retirement plan, was established as of 
September 15, 1939, under the provisions of Act 419 of the 
Legislature of 1939 for the purpose of providing 
retirement allowances and other specified benefits for 
qualified persons employed by State-supported 
educational institutions. The responsibility for the general 
administration and operation of the TRS is vested in its 
Board of Control. The TRS Board of Control consists of 15 
members. The plan is administered by the Retirement 
Systems of Alabama (RSA). Title 16 Chapter 25 of the 
Code of Alabama grants the authority to establish and 
amend the benefit terms to the TRS Board of Control. The 
Plan issues a publicly available financial report that can be 
obtained at www.rsa-al.gov.

Benefits provided. State law establishes retirement 
benefits as well as death and disability benefits and any 
ad hoc increase in postretirement benefits for the TRS. 
Benefits for TRS members vest after 10 years of creditable 
service. TRS members who retire after age 60 with 10 
years or more of creditable service or with 25 years of 
service (regardless of age) are entitled to an annual 
retirement benefit, payable monthly for life unless there is 
a return to full-time employment with a TRS or Employees’ 
Retirement System (ERS) agency, or to temporary 
employment in excess of specified limits. Service and 
disability retirement benefits are based on a guaranteed 
minimum or a formula method, with the member receiving 
payment under the method that yields the highest 
monthly benefit. Under the formula method, Tier 1 
members of the TRS are allowed 2.0125% of their average 
final compensation (highest 3 of the last 10 years) for each 
year of service.

Act 377 of the Legislature of 2012 established a new tier 
of benefits (Tier 2) for members hired on or after January 
1, 2013. Tier 2 TRS members are eligible for retirement 
after age 62 with 10 years or more of creditable service 
and are entitled to an annual retirement benefit, payable 
monthly for life unless there is a return to full-time 
employment with a TRS or ERS agency, or to temporary 
employment in excess of specified limits. Service and 
disability retirement benefits are based on a guaranteed 
minimum or a formula method, with the member receiving 
payment under the method that yields the highest 
monthly benefit. Under formula method, Tier 2 members 
of the TRS are allowed 1.65% of their average final 
compensation (highest 5 of the last 10 years) for each year 
of service. Members are eligible for disability retirement if 
they have 10 years of creditable service, are currently in-
service, and determined by the RSA Medical Board to be 
permanently incapacitated from further performance of 
duty. Pre-retirement death benefits are calculated and 
paid to the beneficiary based on the member’s age, 
service credit, employment status and eligibility for 
retirement.

Contributions. Covered members of the TRS contributed 
5% of earnable compensation to the TRS as required by 
statute until September 30, 2011. From October 1, 2011, to 

52

http://www.rsa-al.gov/


September 30, 2012, covered members of the TRS were 
required by statute to contribute 7.25% of earnable 
compensation. Effective October 1, 2012, covered 
members of the TRS are required by statute to contribute 
7.50% of earnable compensation. Certified law 
enforcement, correctional officers, and firefighters of the 
TRS contributed 6% of earnable compensation as 
required by statute until September 30, 2011. From 
October 1, 2011, to September 30, 2012, certified law 
enforcement, correctional officers, and firefighters of the 
TRS were required by statute to contribute 8.25% of 
earnable compensation. Effective October 1, 2012, 
certified law enforcement, correctional officers, and 
firefighters of the TRS are required by statute to con- 
tribute 8.50% of earnable compensation.

Tier 2 covered members of the TRS contribute 6% of 
earnable compensation to the TRS as required by statute. 
Tier 2 certified law enforcement, correctional officers, and 

firefighters of the TRS are required by statute to 
contribute 7% of earnable compensation.

UAB’s contractually required contribution rate for the year 
ended September 30, 2020 was 12.43% of annual pay for 
Tier 1 members and 11.34% of annual pay for Tier 2 
members. UAB’s contribution rate for the year ended 
September  30, 2019 was 12.41% of annual pay for Tier 1 
members and 11.35% of annual pay for Tier 2 members. 

These required contribution rates are a percent of annual 
payroll, actuarially determined as an amount that, when 
combined with member contributions, is expected to 
finance the costs of benefits earned by members during 
the year, with an additional amount to finance any 
unfunded accrued liability. 

The total contribution requirement for fiscal years 2020, 
2019 and 2018 is as follows:

2020 2019 2018

Employer Contributions $ 98,485,000 $ 97,824,000 $ 94,481,000 

Employee Contributions  57,688,000  57,345,000  56,754,000 

TOTAL CONTRIBUTIONS $ 156,173,000 $ 155,169,000 $ 151,235,000 

Pension Liabilities, Pension Expense, and Deferred 
Outflows of Resources and Deferred Inflows of 
Resources Related to Pensions. At September 30, 2020 
and September 30, 2019, the financial statements of UAB 
reflected a liability of $1.25  billion and $1.17  billion, 
respectively, for its proportionate share of the collective 
net pension liability, as prescribed by GASB 68. At 
September  30, 2020, the collective net pension liability 
was measured as of September  30, 2019 and the total 
pension liability used to calculate the net pension liability 
was determined by an actuarial valuation as of 
September  30, 2018. At September  30, 2019, the 
collective net pension liability was measured as of 
September 30, 2018 and the total pension liability used to 
calculate the net pension liability was determined by an 
actuarial valuation as of September 30, 2017. 

UAB’s proportion of the collective net pension liability was 
based on the employers’ shares of contributions to the 
pension plan relative to the total employer contributions 
of all participating TRS employers. As of September  30, 
2019, UAB’s proportion was 11.26%, which was a decrease 
of 0.49% from its proportion measured as of 
September  30, 2018. At September  30, 2018, UAB’s 
proportion was 11.75%, which was a decrease of 0.06% 
from its proportion measured as of September 30, 2017.

For the years ended September  30, 2020 and 
September  30, 2019, UAB recognized pension expense 
of $112.2  million and $76.3  million, respectively. At 
September  30, 2020 and 2019, UAB reported deferred 
outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources 
related to pensions from the following sources:

as a reduction of the net pension liability in the year 
ending September 30, 2021. Other amounts reported as 
deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of 
resources related to pensions will be recognized in 
pension expense (income) as follows:

Actuarial assumptions. The total pension liability was 
determined by an actuarial valuation as of September 30, 
2018 using the following actuarial assumptions, applied to 
all periods included in the measurement:

Inflation 2.75%

Investment rate of return* 7.70%

Projected salary increases 3.25-5.00%

*Net of pension plan investment expenses

The actuarial assumptions used in the actuarial valuation 
as of September 30, 2018, were based on the results of 
an investigation of the economic and demographic 
experience for the TRS based upon participant data as of 
September 30, 2015. The Board of Control accepted and 
approved these changes in September 2016 which 
became effective the beginning of fiscal year 2016. 

Mortality rates for TRS were based on the RP-2000 White 
Collar Mortality Table projected to 2020 using scale BB 
and adjusted 115% for males and 112% for females age 78 
and older. 

The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan 
investments was determined using a log-normal 
distribution analysis in which best estimate ranges of 
expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net 
of pension plan investment expense and inflation) are 

developed for each major asset class. These ranges are 
combined to produce the long-term expected rate of 
return by weighting the expected future real rates of 
return by the target asset allocation percentage and by 
adding expected inflation. The target asset allocation and 
best estimates of geometric real rates of return for each 
major asset class are as follows:

TOTAL  100.00 %

*Includes assumed rate of inflation of 2.50%.

Discount rate. The discount rate used to measure the 
total pension liability was 7.70%. The projection of cash 
flows used to determine the discount rate assumed that 
plan member contributions will be made at the current 
contribution rate and that the employer contributions will 
be made at rates equal to the difference between 
actuarially determined contribution rates and the member 
rate. Based on those assumptions, components of the 
pension plan’s fiduciary net position were projected to be 
available to make all projected future benefit payments of 
current plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected 
rate of return on pension plan investments was applied to 
all periods of projected benefit payments to determine 
the total pension liability.

Sensitivity of UAB’s proportionate share of the net 
pension liability to changes in the  discount  rate.  The 
following table reflects UAB’s proportionate share of the 
net pension liability, as prescribed by GASB 68, 
calculated using the discount rate of 7.70%, as well as 
what UAB’s proportionate share of the net pension 
liability would be if it were calculated using a discount rate

Pension plan fiduciary net position. Detailed information 
about the pension plan’s fiduciary net position is available 
in the separately issued RSA Comprehensive Annual 
Report for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019. The 
supporting actuarial information is included in the GASB 
Statement No. 67 Report for the TRS prepared as of 
September  30, 2019. The auditor’s report dated August 
18, 2020, on the total pension liability, total deferred 
outflows of resources, total deferred inflows of resources, 
total pension expense for the sum of all participating

Other Retirement Plans
As previously noted, certain employees also participate in 
a voluntary 403(b) plan, which is a defined contribution 
plan. In defined contribution plans, benefits depend solely 
on amounts contributed plus investment earnings. All full-
time regular monthly employees are eligible to participate 
from the date of employment. UAB contributes a matching 
amount of up to 5% of total salaries for participating 
employees. UAB’s contribution is funded as it accrues 
and, along with that of the employee, is immediately and 
fully vested. The contributions for fiscal years 2020 and 
2019, excluding employee amounts not eligible for 
matching, were approximately $64.1  million and 
$60.1 million, which included approximately $32.0 million 
and $30.1  million each from UAB and its employees, 
respectively.

The LLC sponsors a voluntary 403(b) retirement plan for 
eligible employees. The 403(b) plan is a voluntary, 
defined-contribution, tax-deferred as well as Roth after tax 
plan governed by Internal Revenue Code 403(b). TIAA is 
the administrator for the voluntary retirement program. 
Employees are vested after 3 years of employment. 
Eligibility for matching is for all full-time and part-time 
regular, twelve-hour shift, and weekend staff employees.

In fiscal year 2020, employer matching contributions in 
the voluntary 403(b) Plan (inclusive of The University of 
Alabama, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, The 
University of Alabama in Huntsville, and the UA System 
Office), and the UAB Hospital Management, LLC 403(b) 
Plan were temporarily suspended for the period of May 
2020 through September 2020. The suspension was due 
to uncertainty concerning the potential financial impacts 
of the COVID-19 Pandemic and was a joint management 
decision by Senior Administration of the UA System and 
each University

The University, the Hospital, LLC and UABRF total salaries 
and wages for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 were 
approximately $1.33 billion and $1.25 billion, respectively. 
Total salaries and wages during fiscal years 2020 and 
2019 for covered employees participating in TRS were 
approximately $816.8  million and $806.4  million, 
respectively. Total salaries and wages during fiscal years 
2020  and 2019 for covered employees participating in 
the 403(b) Plan were approximately $710.1  million and 
$649.0 million, respectively.

Triton sponsors a 401(k) plan covering substantially all 
employees who have completed at least six months of 
service. Information regarding this benefit is presented in 
Triton’s annual report.

Compensated Absences
Certain UAB employees accumulate vacation and sick 
leave at varying rates depending upon their years of 
continuous service and their payroll classification, subject 
to maximum limitations. Upon termination of employment, 
employees are paid unused accrued vacation at their 
regular rate of pay up to a designated maximum number 
of days. 

In accordance with GASB Statement No. 16, Accounting 
for Compensated Absences, the financial statements 
include accruals of approximately $78 million and $71 
million as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, 
for accrued vacation pay and salary-related payments 
associated with vacation pay. There is no such accrual 
recognized for sick leave benefits because there is no 
terminal cash benefit available to employees for 
accumulated sick leave.

(10) Post-Employment Benefits
UAB offers other postemployment health care benefits 
(OPEB) to all employees who officially retire from UAB. 
Health care benefits are offered through the Alabama 
Retired Education Employees Health Care Trust Plan 
(PEEHIP) with TRS or certain retired employees may elect 
to continue to participate in UAB’s group health plan until 
they are eligible for Medicare by paying the full cost of the 
plan premium. Retired employees age 65 or older who 
are eligible for Medicare must enroll in the Medicare 
Coordinated Plan under which Medicare is the primary 
insurer and UAB’s health care plan becomes the 
secondary insurer. Despite the availability of the UAB 
plan, most retirees elect to participate in the PEEHIP with 
TRS, in which case the retirees pay a portion of the 
PEEHIP premium, with UAB paying an allocation towards 
the cost of retiree coverage.

Certain retirees may also elect to continue their basic 
term life insurance coverage and accidental death and 
dismemberment insurance up to certain maximum 

55

http://www.rsa-al.gov/


amounts. The retirees pay the full amount of the 
premiums in such cases. Retirees are not eligible for 
tuition assistance benefits themselves. However, their 
unmarried dependent children may qualify in some cases.

PEEHIP
Plan description. The Alabama Retired Education 
Employees’ Health Care Trust (Trust) is a cost-sharing 
multiple-employer defined benefit postemployment 
healthcare plan that administers healthcare benefits to 
the retirees of participating state and local educational 
institutions. The Trust was established under the Alabama 
Retiree Health Care Funding Act of 2007 which 
authorized and directed the Public Education Employees’ 
Health Insurance Board (Board) to create an irrevocable 
trust to fund postemployment healthcare benefits to 
retirees participating in PEEHIP. Active and retiree health 
insurance benefits are paid through the Public Education 
Employees’ Health Insurance Plan. In accordance with 
GASB, the Trust is considered a component unit of the 
State of Alabama (State) and is included in the State’s 
Comprehensive Annual Financial Report.

The PEEHIP was established in 1983 pursuant to the 
provisions of the Code of Alabama 1975, Title 16, Chapter 
25A (Act 83-455) to provide a uniform plan of health 
insurance for active and retired employees of state and 
local educational institutions which provide instruction at 
any combination of grades K-14 (collectively, eligible 
employees), and to provide a method for funding the 
benefits related to the plan. The four-year universities 
participate in the plan with respect to their retired 
employees, and are eligible and may elect to participate 
in the plan with respect to their active employees. 
Responsibility for the establishment of the health 
insurance plan and its general administration and 
operations is vested in the Board. The Board is a 
corporate body for purposes of management of the health 
insurance plan. The Code of Alabama 1975, Section 
16-25A-4 provides the Board with the authority to amend 
the benefit provisions in order to provide reasonable 
assurance of stability in future years for the plan. All 
assets of the PEEHIP are held in trust for the payment of 
health insurance benefits. The Teachers’ Retirement 
System of Alabama (TRS) has been appointed as the 
administrator of the PEEHIP and, consequently, serves as 
the administrator of the Trust.

Benefits provided. PEEHIP offers a basic hospital medical 
plan to active members and non-Medicare eligible 
retirees. Benefits include inpatient hospitalization for a 
maximum of 365 days without a dollar limit, inpatient 
rehabilitation, outpatient care, physician services, and 
prescription drugs.

Active employees and non-Medicare eligible retirees who 
do not have Medicare eligible dependents can enroll in a 
health maintenance organization (HMO) in lieu of the 
basic hospital medical plan. The HMO includes hospital 
medical benefits, dental benefits, vision benefits, and an 

extensive formulary. However, participants in the HMO 
are required to receive care from a participating physician 
in the HMO plan.

The PEEHIP offers four optional plans (Hospital Indemnity, 
Cancer, Dental, and Vision) that may be selected in 
addition to or in lieu of the basic hospital medical plan or 
HMO. The Hospital Indemnity Plan provides a per-day 
benefit for hospital confinement, maternity, intensive care, 
cancer, and convalescent care. The Cancer Plan covers 
cancer disease only and benefits are provided regardless 
of other insurance. Coverage includes a per-day benefit 
for each hospital confinement related to cancer. The 
Dental Plan covers diagnostic and preventative services, 
as well as basic and major dental services. Diagnostic and 
preventative services include oral examinations, teeth 
cleaning, x-rays, and emergency office visits. Basic and 
major services include fillings, general aesthetics, oral 
surgery not covered under a Group Medical Program, 
periodontics, endodontics, dentures, bridgework, and 
crowns. Dental services are subject to a maximum of 
$1,250 per year for individual coverage and $1,000 per 
person per year for family coverage. The Vision Plan 
covers annual eye examinations, eye glasses, and contact 
lens prescriptions.

PEEHIP members may opt to elect the PEEHIP 
Supplemental Plan as their hospital medical coverage in 
lieu of the PEEHIP Hospital Medical Plan. The PEEHIP 
Supplemental Plan provides secondary benefits to the 
member’s primary plan provided by another employer. 
Only active and non-Medicare retiree members and 
dependents are eligible for the PEEHIP Supplemental 
Plan. There is no premium required for this plan, and the 
plan covers most out-of-pocket expenses not covered by 
the primary plan. The plan cannot be used as a 
supplement to Medicare, the PEEHIP Hospital Medical 
Plan, or the State or Local Governmental Plans 
administered by the State Employees’ Insurance Board 
(SEIB).

Medicare eligible members and Medicare eligible 
dependents who are covered on a retiree contract were 
enrolled in the United Healthcare Group Medicare 
Advantage plan for PEEHIP retirees. Effective January 1, 
2020, Humana Insurance Company replaced United 
Healthcare as the administrator of the PEEHIP Group 
Medicare Advantage (PPO) Plan. The plan is fully insured, 
and members are able to have all of their Medicare Part A 
(hospital insurance), Part B (medical insurance), and Part D 
(prescription drug coverage) in one convenient plan. 
Retirees can continue to see their same providers with no 
interruption and see any doctor who accepts Medicare on 
a national basis. Members have the same benefits in and 
out-of-network and there is no additional retiree cost 
share if a retiree uses an out-of-network provider and no 
balance billing from the provider.

Contributions. The Code of Alabama 1975, Section 
16-25A-8 and the Code of Alabama 1975, Section, 
16-25A-8.1 provide the Board with the authority to set the 
contribution requirements for plan members and the 
authority to set the employer contribution requirements 
for each required class, respectively. Additionally, the 
Board is required to certify to the Governor and the 
Legislature, the amount, as a monthly premium per active 
employee, necessary to fund the coverage of active and 
retired member benefits for the following fiscal year. The 
Legislature then sets the premium rate in the annual 
appropriation bill.

For employees who retired after September 30, 2005, but 
before January 1, 2012, the employer contribution of the 
health insurance premium set forth by the Board for each 
retiree class is reduced by 2% for each year of service 
less than 25 and increased by 2% percent for each year 
of service over 25 subject to adjustment by the Board for 
changes in Medicare premium costs required to be paid 
by a retiree. In no case does the employer contribution of 
the health insurance premium exceed 100% of the total 
health insurance premium cost for the retiree.

For employees who retired after December 31, 2011, the 
employer contribution to the health insurance premium 
set forth by the Board for each retiree class is reduced by 
4% for each year of service less than 25 and increased by 
2% for each year over 25, subject to adjustment by the 
Board for changes in Medicare premium costs required to 
be paid by a retiree. In no case does the employer 
contribution of the health insurance premium exceed 
100% of the total health insurance premium cost for the 
retiree. For employees who retired after December 31, 
2011, who are not covered by Medicare, regardless of 
years of service, the employer contribution to the health 

insurance premium set forth by the Board for each retiree 
class is reduced by a percentage equal to 1% multiplied 
by the difference between the Medicare entitlement age 
and the age of the employee at the time of retirement as 
determined by the Board. This reduction in the employer 
contribution ceases upon notification to the Board of the 
attainment of Medicare coverage.

OPEB Liabilities, OPEB Expense, and Deferred Outflows 
of Resources and Deferred Inflows of Resources 
Related to OPEB. At September 30, 2020 and 2019, the 
financial statements of UAB reflected a liability of 
$265.2  million and $659.9  million, respectively for its 
proportionate share of collective net OPEB liability, as 
prescribed by GASB 75. The collective net OPEB liability 
was measured as of September  30, 2019 and the total 
OPEB liability used to calculate the net OPEB liability was 
determined by an actuarial valuation as of September 30, 
2018. UAB’s proportion of collective net OPEB liability was 
based on a projection of UAB’s long-term share of 
contributions to the OPEB plan relative to the projected 
contributions of all participating employers, actuarially 
determined. At September  30, 2019, UAB’s proportion 
was 7.03%, which was a decrease of 1% from its 
proportion measured as of September  30, 2018. At 
September  30, 2018, the UAB's proportion was 8.03%, 
which was a decrease of 0.64% from its proportion 
measured as of September 30, 2017.

For the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, UAB 
recognized an OPEB benefit of $24.5  million and an 
OPEB expense of $52.9  million, respectively with no 
special funding situations. At September  30, 2020 and 
2019, UAB reported deferred outflows of resources and 
deferred inflows of resources related to the PEEHIP plan 
from the following sources:

$20.8 million reported as deferred outflows of resources 
related to OPEB resulting from UAB’s contributions 
subsequent to the measurement date will be recognized 
as a reduction of the net OPEB liability in the year ending 
September 30, 2021. Other amounts reported as deferred 
outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources 
related to OPEB will be recognized in OPEB expense as 
follows:

Years ending September 30:

2025  (68,559,430) 

Thereafter  (11,544,936) 

Actuarial assumptions. The total OPEB liability for the 
PEEHIP was determined by an actuarial valuation as of 
September  30, 2018, using the following actuarial 
assumptions, applied to all periods included in the 
measurement:

Inflation  2.75 %

Projected Salary Increase¹ 3.25%-5.00%

Long-Term Investment Rate of Return²  7.25 %

Municipal Bond Index Rate at the Measurement  3.00 %

Municipal Bond Index Rate at the Prior  4.18 %

Projected Year for Fiduciary Net Position (FNP) to be 2055

Single Equivalent Interest Rate the Measurement  5.50 %

Single Equivalent Interest Rate the Prior  4.44 %

Healthcare Cost Trend Rate

   Pre-Medicare Eligible  6.75 %

   Medicare Eligible **

Ultimate Trend Rate

   Pre-Medicare Eligible 4.75% in 2026

   Medicare Eligible 4.75% in 2024

¹Includes 3.00% wage inflation.

²Compounded annually, net of investment expense, and includes 
inflation.

**Initial Medicare claims are set based on scheduled increases through 
plan year 2022.

Mortality rates for the period after service retirement for 
both PEEHIP and UAB plan are according to the RP-2000 
White Collar Mortality Table projected to 2020 using 
scale BB and adjusted 115% for all ages for males and 
112% for ages 78 and over for females. The rates of 
disabled mortality were based on the RP-2000 Disabled 
Mortality Table projected to 2020 using scale BB and 
adjusted 105% for males and 120% for females.

The decremental assumptions used in the valuation were 
selected based on the actuarial experience study 
prepared as of September 30, 2015, submitted to and 
adopted by the Teachers’ Retirement System of Alabama 
Board on September 13, 2016.

The remaining actuarial assumptions (e.g., initial per 
capita costs, health care cost trends, rate of plan 
participation, rates of plan election, etc.) were based on 
the September  30, 2018 valuation, however updated 
Medicare Advantage premium rates which reflect the 
repeal of the ACA Health Insurer Fee, updated Optionals 
claims costs, and updated participation assumptions were 
used in this report.

The long-term expected return on plan assets is to be 
reviewed as part of regular experience studies prepared 
every five years, in conjunction with similar analysis for 
the Teachers’ Retirement System of Alabama. Several 
factors should be considered in evaluating the long-term 
rate of return assumption, including long-term historical 
data, estimates inherent in current market data, and a log-
normal distribution analysis in which best-estimate ranges 
of expected future real rates of return (expected return, 
net of investment expense and inflation), as developed for 
each major asset class. These ranges should be 
combined to produce the long-term expected rate of 
return by weighting the expected future real rates of 
return by the target asset allocation percentage and then 
adding expected inflation. The assumption is intended to 
be a long-term assumption and is not expected to change 
absent a significant change in the asset allocation, a 
change in the inflation assumption, or a fundamental 
change in the market that alters expected returns in future 
years.

The long-term expected rate of return on the OPEB plan 
investments is determined based on the allocation of 
assets by asset class and by the mean and variance of 
real returns.

The target asset allocation and best estimates of 
expected geometric real rates of return for each major 
asset class is summarized below:

Target 
Allocation

Long-Term 
Expected Real
Rate of Return*

Fixed Income  30.00  %  4.40  %

U.S. Large Stocks  38.00  %  8.00  %

U.S. Mid Stocks  8.00  %  10.00  %

U.S. Small Stocks  4.00  %  11.00  %
International Developed Market Stocks  15.00  %  9.50  %

Cash  5.00  %  1.50  %

TOTAL  100.00  %

         * Geometric mean, includes 2.5% inflation

Discount Rate. The discount rate (also known as the 
Single Equivalent Interest Rate (SEIR), as described by 
GASB 74) used to measure the PEEHIP total OPEB liability 
at September  30, 2019 was 5.50%. The discount rate 
used to measure the total OPEB liability at the prior 
measurement date was 4.44%. Premiums paid to the 
Public Education Employees’ Health Insurance Board for 
active employees shall include an amount to partially fund 
the cost of coverage for retired employees. The 

58



projection of cash flows used to determine the discount 
rate assumed that plan contributions will be made at the 
current contribution rates. Each year, the State specifies 
the monthly employer rate that participating school 
systems must contribute for each active employee. 
Approximately, 24.245% of the employer contributions 
were used to assist in funding retiree benefit payments in 
2019 and it is assumed that the amount will increase by 
1.00% per year and continue into the future. The discount 
rate determination will use a municipal bond rate to the 
extent the trust is projected to run out of money before all 
benefits are paid. Therefore, the projected future benefit 
payments for all current plan members were projected 
through 2117. The long-term rate of return is used until the 
assets are expected to be depleted in 2055, after which 
the municipal bond rate is used.

Sensitivity of the UAB’s proportionate share of the net 
OPEB liability to changes in the healthcare cost trend 
rates. The following table reflects UAB’s proportionate 
share of the net OPEB liability of the Trust, as prescribed 
by GASB 75,  calculated using the current healthcare 
trend rate, as well as what the net OPEB liability would be 
if calculated using one percentage point lower or one 
percentage point higher than the current rate. A one 
percent point decrease would change the current 
healthcare trend rate from 6.75% to 5.75%, the pre-
Medicare from 4.75% to 3.75%, the Medicare eligible from 
4.75% to 3.75%. A one percent point increase would 
change the current healthcare trend rate from 6.75% to 
7.75%, the pre-Medicare from 4.75% to 5.75%, the 
Medicare eligible from 4.75% to 5.75%.

UAB Plan
Plan description. The UAB plan is considered a single-
employer plan which is administered by University of 
Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). The UAB Plan offers its 
members hospital benefits, major medical benefits, a 
prescription drug program and a basic term life insurance 
up to an established maximum policy limit. The health 
care benefits cover medical and hospitalization costs for 
retirees and their dependents. The portion of the UAB 
plan related to health care may be amended by the 
approval of the President of UAB upon recommendation 
from the Benefits Committee. The portion of the UAB plan 
related to the life insurance may be amended by the 
System.

Benefits provided. UAB employees can participate in the 
UAB plan as a retiree if the following condition are met; 
retiree has 25 years of creditable service, regardless of 
age (Tier I only), or retiree has 10 years of service and is 
60 years old (62 years old for Tier II), or retiree has 10 
years of service and is determined disabled the Social 
Security Administration or the Teachers’ Retirement 
System of Alabama’s Medical Board. These retired UAB 
employees may elect to continue to participate in UAB 
plan until they are eligible for Medicare by paying the full 
cost of the plan premium. Retired employees age 65 or 
older who are eligible for Medicare must enroll in the 
Medicare Coordinated Plan under which Medicare is the 
primary insurer and UAB plan becomes the secondary 
insurer. Despite the availability of the UAB plan, most 
retirees elect to participate in the PEEHIP with TRS. The 
UAB Plan consists of hospital benefits, major medical 
benefits, a prescription drug program and a basic term life 
insurance up to an established maximum policy limit.

Employees included in the actuarial valuation include 
active employees, retirees and disabled employees 
enrolled in the medical plan and retirees not enrolled in 
the medical plan with retiree life insurance. The following 
table summarizes the membership of the UAB Plan as of 
September 30, 2019, the Valuation Date.

Membership: 2020

Inactive Employees or Beneficiaries Currently Receiving Benefits  238 

Inactive Members Entitled To But Not Yet Receiving Benefits  — 

Active Employees  10,824 

TOTAL MEMBERSHIP  11,062 

Contributions. UAB retired employees make 
contributions to the plan by making premium payments 
associated with their selected health plan option. Eligible 
disabled retirees are responsible for only the employee 
portion of those premiums and UAB is responsible for the 
employer portion. All other UAB retirees are responsible 
for the full premium cost of the plan and in no case does 
the employer contribute to the plan.

OPEB Liabilities, OPEB Expense, and Deferred Outflows 
of Resources and Deferred Inflows of Resources 
Related to OPEB. At September 30, 2020 and 2019, UAB 

59

http://www.rsa-al.gov/
http://www.rsa-al.gov/


reported a liability of $6.3  million and  $17.7  million, 
respectively for the total OPEB liability (TOL). The TOL is 
based upon an actuarial valuation as of the valuation date, 
September 30, 2019. An expected TOL is determined as 
of September  30, 2018, the prior measurement date, 
using standard roll back techniques. The roll back 
calculation begins with the TOL, as of the Measurement 
Date, September 30, 2018, adds the expected benefit 
payments for the year, deducts interest at the Discount 
Rate for the year, and then subtracts the annual Normal 
Cost (also called the Service Cost).

For the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, UAB 
recognized an OPEB benefit of $644,580 and an OPEB 
expense of $576,312, respectively with no special funding 
situations. At September  30, 2020 and 2019, UAB 
reported deferred outflows of resources and deferred 
inflows of resources related to the UAB plan from the 
following sources:

Mortality rates for the period after service retirement for 
the UAB plan are according to the RP-2000 White Collar 
Mortality Table projected to 2020 using scale BB and 
adjusted 115% for all ages for males and 112% for ages 78 
and over for females. The rates of disabled mortality were 
based on the RP-2000 Disabled Mortality Table projected 
to 2020 using scale BB and adjusted 105% for males and 
120% for females.

The decremental assumptions used in the valuation were 
selected based on the actuarial experience study 
prepared as of September 30, 2015, and are reasonable 
expectations of anticipated experience under the Plan.

The remaining actuarial assumptions (e.g., initial per 
capita costs, health care cost trends, rate of plan 
participation, rates of plan election, etc.) used in the 
September 30, 2019 valuation were based on a review of 
recent plan experience performed concurrently with the 
September 30, 2019 valuation.

The UAB plan does not hold any plan assets, as such, 
there are no long-term expected rate of return or target 
allocation presented.

Discount Rate. The discount rate, as defined by 
Paragraph 155 of GASB 75 is to be a 20-year tax- exempt 
municipal bond (rating AA/Aa or higher) rate (Municipal 
Bond Index Rate). The Municipal Bond Index Rate used 
for this purpose is the September average of the Bond 
Buyer General Obligation 20-year Municipal Bond Index 

60



published weekly by The Bond Buyer 
(www.bondbuyer.com) and was 2.66% as of the 
measurement date. On the prior measurement date, the 
Municipal Bond Index Rate was 4.18%. 

Sensitivity of the UAB Plan's net OPEB liability to 
changes in the healthcare cost trend rates. The 
following table presents the total OPEB Liability of the 
UAB Plan, calculated using the current healthcare trend 
rate, as well as what the total OPEB Liability would be if 
calculated using one percentage point lower or one 
percentage point higher than the current rate. A one 
percent point decrease would change the current 
healthcare trend rate from 6.75%% to 5.75% and pre-
Medicare from 4.75% to 3.75%. A one percent point 
increase would change the current healthcare trend rate 
from 6.75% to 7.75% and the pre-Medicare from 4.75% to 
5.75%.

Federal Direct 
Student Loan 
Program

The Federal Direct Student Loan Program (FDSLP) was 
established under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as 
amended in the Student Loan Reform Act of 1993. The 
FDSLP enables an eligible student or parent to obtain a 
loan to pay for the student’s cost of attendance directly 
through the university rather than through private lenders. 
UAB began participation in the FDSLP on July 1, 1994. As 
a university qualified to originate loans, UAB is 
responsible for handling the complete loan process, 
including funds management, as well as promissory note 
functions. UAB is not responsible for collection of these 
loans. During the years ended September 30, 2020 and 
2019, UAB disbursed approximately $166.6  million and 
$167.1 million, respectively, under the FDSLP.

(12) Grants and Contracts
At September  30, 2020 and 2019, UAB had been 
awarded approximately $703.1 million and $546.3 million, 
respectively, in grants and contracts which have not been 
expended. These awards, which represent commitments 
of sponsors to provide funds for specific research, 
training, and service projects, have not been reflected in 
the financial statements.

(14) Contingencies and Commitments
UAB has sovereign immunity and is, therefore, in the 
opinion of UAB counsel, immune to ordinary tort actions 
including those based on medical malpractice or general 
injury to patients. Consequently, while UAB is sometimes 
named as defendant in malpractice actions and other 
actions for injuries arising in the Hospital, it has 
consistently been dismissed from those lawsuits on the 
basis of the sovereign immunity doctrine. That doctrine 
also protects UAB from vicarious liability arising from the 
negligence of its employees. To the extent that UAB 
employees are sued in their individual capacity for actions 
related to their official duties within the line and scope of 
their employment, UAB has defended those actions and 
paid for any resulting costs through its self-insured trust 
fund. While UAB is not aware of any impending threat to 
this doctrine, UAB is a named insured under the terms of 
the PLTF and excess insurance purchased from 
commercial companies (Note 8). There are some 
exceptions to the sovereign immunity doctrine, most 
notably federal court cases arising under the federal 
constitution or federal statutes.

UAB is engaged in various legal actions in the ordinary 
course of business. Management does not believe the 
ultimate outcome of these actions will have a material 
adverse effect on the financial statements. However, the 
settlement of legal actions is subject to inherent 
uncertainties and it is possible that such outcomes could 
differ materially from management’s current expectations.

Amounts received or receivable from grantor agencies 
are subject to audit and adjustments by such agencies, 
principally the United States Government. Any disallowed 
claims, including amounts already collected, may 
constitute a liability of UAB. The amount, if any, of 
expenditures that may be disallowed by the grantor 
cannot be determined at this time, although UAB expects 
any such amounts to be immaterial.

UAB has contracted for the construction and renovation 
of several facilities. At September 30, 2020 and 2019, the 
estimated remaining cost to complete the construction 
and renovation of these facilities was approximately 
$165  million and $246  million, respectively, which is 
expected to be financed from private gifts, grants, bond 
proceeds, and UAB reserves.

(15) Segment Reporting
As discussed in Note 1, UAB’s two significant identifiable activities that have bonds outstanding where revenue is 
pledged in support of the bonds are the University and the Hospital. Condensed financial statement information related 
to the University and Hospital as of and for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:

(16) Health Care Services
Net Patient Service Revenue
The Hospital has agreements with governmental and 
other third-party payors that provide for reimbursement to 
the Hospital at amounts different from its established 
rates. Contractual adjustments under third-party 
reimbursement programs represent the difference 
between the Hospital’s billings at established rates for 
services and amounts reimbursed by third-party payors. A 
summary of the basis of reimbursement with major third-
party payors follows:

Medicare. Substantially all acute-care services rendered 
to Medicare program beneficiaries are paid at 
prospectively determined rates. These rates vary 
according to the patient classification systems that are 
based on clinical, diagnostic, and other factors. 
Additionally, University Hospital is reimbursed for both its 
direct and indirect medical education costs (as defined), 
principally based on per-resident prospective payment 
amounts and certain adjustments to prospective rate-per-
discharge operating reimbursement payments. The 
Hospital generally is reimbursed for certain retroactively 
settled items at tentative rates, with final settlement 
determined after submission of annual cost reports by the 
Hospital and audits by the Medicare fiscal intermediary. 
the Hospital’s cost reports have been audited and settled 
for all fiscal years through 2012. Revenue from the 
Medicare program accounted for approximately 21% of 
the Hospital’s net patient service revenue for the years 
ended September 30, 2020 and 2019. 

Section 302 of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 
2006 authorized a permanent program involving the use 
of third-party recovery audit contractors (RACs) to identify 
Medicare overpayments and underpayments made to 
providers. As of September  30, 2020, the Hospital 
reported claims in various stages of review based on the 
requests received by the RACs during the fiscal year. 
Payment recoveries resulting from RAC reviews are 
appealable through administrative and judicial processes, 
and the Hospital intends to pursue the reversal of adverse 
determinations, where appropriate. the Hospital cannot 
predict with certainty the impact of the Medicare RAC 
program on our future results of operations or cash flows. 

Blue Cross. Inpatient services rendered to Blue Cross 
subscribers are paid at a prospectively determined per 
diem rate. Outpatient services are reimbursed at a 
prospectively determined rate or under a cost 
reimbursement methodology. The method of 
reimbursement is determined by the procedures that are 
performed. For outpatient services reimbursed under the 
cost reimbursement methodology, a final settlement is 
determined after submission of annual cost reports by the 

Hospital and audits thereof by Blue Cross. The Hospital’s 
Blue Cross cost reports have been audited and settled for 
all fiscal years through 2016. Effective December 1, 2016 
Blue Cross outpatient services began being reimbursed 
under the Enhanced Ambulatory Payment Group (EAPG) 
methodology. This is a prospective payment methodology 
with no retroactive settlement. Revenue from the Blue 
Cross program accounted for approximately 34% of the 
Hospital’s net patient service revenue for the years ended 
September 30, 2020 and 2019. 

Medicaid. Inpatient services rendered to Medicaid 
program beneficiaries are reimbursed at all-inclusive 
prospectively determined per diem rates. Outpatient 
services are reimbursed based on an established fee 
schedule. the Hospital is designated as a 
Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) and receives 
payments under the Medicaid DSH program. In addition, 
as a participant in the Alabama Medicaid Plan, the 
Hospital also receives supplemental payments based on 
formulas established by the Alabama Medicaid Agency. 
The net benefit associated with the Hospital’s 
participation in these programs, totaling approximately 
$103.1  million and $65.1  million in 2020 and 2019, 
respectively, is included in net patient service revenue in 
the accompanying statement of revenues, expenses and 
changes in net position. There can be no assurance that 
the Hospital will continue to qualify for future participation 
in these programs or that the programs will not ultimately 
be discontinued or materially modified. 

Revenue from the Medicaid program accounted for 
approximately 20% of the Hospital’s net patient service 
revenue for the year ended September 30, 2020 and 16% 
for the year ended September 30, 2019. 

Other. The Hospital has also entered into payment 
agreements with certain commercial insurance carriers, 
health maintenance organizations, and preferred provider 
organizations. The basis for payments to the Hospital 
under these agreements includes discounts from 
established charges and prospectively determined daily 
and case rates. 

The composition of Hospital operating revenue follows:

Charity Care
The Hospital maintains records to identify and monitor the 
level of charity care it provides. These records include the 
amount of charges foregone for services and supplies 
furnished under its charity care policy, the estimated costs 
of those services, and supplies and equivalent service 
statistics. 

The estimated cost of charity care provided during the 
years ended September  30, 2020 and 2019 was 
approximately $35.2  million and $32.3  million, 
respectively, calculated based on the ratio of total direct

Related Parties
The Hospital and the other divisions of UAB provide a 
variety of support services to each other. The cost of 
these services is allocated to the end user on bases 
which vary according to the service being furnished. 
These services are paid for by transfers of funds which 
reduce operating expenses of the unit providing the 
service and are included in the operating costs of the unit 
receiving the service. Administrative and purchased 
services provided by UAB and allocated to and 
reimbursed by the Hospital during the years ended 
September  30, 2020 and 2019 were approximately 
$37.3  million and $38.7  million, respectively. In addition, 
during the years ended September  30, 2020 and 2019, 
the Hospital transferred approximately $191.7  million and 
$153.6  million, respectively, to UAB to support UAB’s 
academic and medical programs. 

As noted in footnote 7, in June 2019, University Hospital 
borrowed $77.0 million of UAB Medicine Finance 
Authority 2019A and 2019B Revenue Bond proceeds from 
UAB Health System. $42.5 million of the loan amount was 
distributed to the Hospital as of September 30, 2020 for 
capital improvement project spending during the year and 
the remaining $34.6 million is held in trust for future 
projects. The Hospital recorded a note payable for the 
$77.0 million loan amount and the undistributed amounts 
are recorded as Due from affiliate on the statement of net 
position. 

During 2008, University Hospital entered into an 
operating agreement with HSF whereby HSF would lease 
two floors of the Women and Infants Center (“WIC”).  HSF 
reimbursed University Hospital for construction costs of 
this space as they were incurred on a square-footage 
basis. Total reimbursements are being amortized as rent 
revenue on a straight-line basis over a period equal to the 
90 year total lease term, commencing on February 22, 
2010, the date the building was placed into service. The 
Hospital had received reimbursements from HSF totaling 
approximately $14.7 million in 2020 and 2019, of which 
approximately $12.8 million and $12.9 million respectively,  
is included in the accompanying statement of net position 
as unearned revenue-other for the years ended 
September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

The Board and the HSF’s board have entered into an 
agreement under which UAB and HSF have established a 
common management group, the UAB Health System 
(Health System), to provide management for their existing 
and future health care delivery operations.

In connection with its agreement with the Health System, 
the Hospital partially funded the operations of the Health 
System and its corporate office, charging approximately 
$14.8 million and $13.2 million to other operating expense 
in fiscal year 2020 and 2019, respectively.  In addition, the 
Health System periodically makes payments on behalf of 
the Hospital for which it is reimbursed. The Hospital had a 
net payable to the Health System of approximately 
$9.8 million and $6.7 million at September 30, 2020 and 
2019, respectively. 

In March 2014, the Hospital assumed operations of the 
outpatient clinics in The Kirklin Clinic and entered into an 
agreement with HSF to lease the land and the building 
known as The Kirklin Clinic. The initial term of the lease, 
which is cancellable by either party upon proper written 
notice and without penalty, is five years, with automatic 
one-year renewals thereafter.

VF’s primary purpose is to provide a group medical 
practice for physicians who are faculty members in the 
UAB School of Medicine Huntsville program. It is 
governed by a 17-member board of directors, consisting 
of three nonvoting members and 14 voting members, of 
whom seven are affiliated with UAB.

The Hospital received premium revenue (capitation fees) 
of approximately $82 million and $73 million from Triton 
during the years ended September  30, 2020 and 2019, 
respectively.

The Hospital purchased $458 million and $406 million in 
management, administrative, and staffing services from 
the LLC during the years ended September 30, 2020 and 
2019, respectively. Payment for contract labor as reported 
on the Statements of Cash Flows includes amounts paid 
to employees of the LLC and HSF.
