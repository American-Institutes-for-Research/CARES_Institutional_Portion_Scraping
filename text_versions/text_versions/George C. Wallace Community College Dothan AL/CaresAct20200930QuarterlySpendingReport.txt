CARES Act Update: August 12, 2020 

Based on the unprecedented interruption for college and university students, Congress passed the CARES 
Act (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act) on March 27 to assist students in covering the unexpected 
costs of the COVID-19 pandemic response. 

Wallace Community College-Dothan received $1,827,879 for direct student aid.  The College signed and returned to 
the Department the Certification and Agreement and the assurance that the institution has used, or intends to use, no 
less than 50 percent of the funds received under Section 18004(a)(1) of the CARES Act to provide Emergency 
Financial Aid Grants to students on April 15, 2020. 
 
As of May 31, 2020, $1,415,115 emergency aid grants were distributed to 2419 eligible Wallace students 
($585.00 per student). 

On June 8, 2020, College notified all eligible Spring 2020 students who were enrolled in Summer 2020 via email that 
additional aid was available for students with continuing COVID-19-related needs. Students had until June 14, 2020, 
at 11:30 p.m. to certify continuing needs for CARES Act grants. 

As of June 23, 2020, the remaining $412,764 CARES Act funds were distributed to 1091 eligible students in 
the amount of $378.33 per student. 

The College used the method of selection based on U.S. Department of Education eligibility protocol. To be eligible, 
students had to be enrolled in a degree or certificate program and had to be taking at least one traditional course that 
transitioned to an online format after March 16. Additionally, students must be a PELL recipient or PELL eligible. Dual 
enrollment, incarcerated students, and online students do not qualify. 

The College used the universal disbursement method to offer aid to all eligible students to offset attendance-related 
costs. The disbursement method and amount were determined using the method and minimum technology amount 
suggested in the April 14, 2020 Alabama Community College System (ACCS) MEMO 2020-EXE-033 of $300.00, with 
an additional $285.00 included to offset other costs.  The remaining funds were distributed based on eligible students 
who certified a continuing need. 

As of August 12, 2020, all CARES Act funds for direct student aid have been distributed.
