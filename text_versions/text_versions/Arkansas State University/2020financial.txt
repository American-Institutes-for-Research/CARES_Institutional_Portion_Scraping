ARKANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM 
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (UNAUDITED) 

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2020 

 

Financial Statement Presentation 
 
This section of the Arkansas State University (The University) annual financial report presents discussion and analysis of the Univer-
sity's financial performance during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020.  This discussion and analysis is prepared by the University's 
financial administrators and is intended to provide information on the financial activities of the University that is both relevant and 
easily understandable.  Information is also provided on the University's financial position as of June 30, 2019 as further explanation 
of the results of the year's financial activities.  As shown in the information that follows, the overall financial position of the Univer-
sity has remained stable during the fiscal year. 
  
The statements have been prepared using the format specified in Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statements no. 
34 and 35.  GASB Statement no. 34 does not require the presentation of comparative information from the previous fiscal year but 
does require a discussion of any significant changes in the University's financial position or the results of its operations.   
 
In June 2011, the GASB issued Statement no. 63, Financial Reporting of Deferred Outflows of Resources, Deferred Inflows of Re-
sources, and Net Position.  This statement provides financial reporting guidance for deferred outflows of resources and deferred 
inflows of resources.   The use of net position as the residual of all other elements presented in a statement of financial position has 
also been identified.  This statement amends the net asset reporting requirement in GASB Statement no. 34 and other pronounce-
ments by incorporating deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources into the definitions of the required compo-
nents of the residual measure and by renaming that measure as net position, rather than net assets. 
 
In March 2012, the GASB issued Statement no. 65, Items Previously Reported as Assets and Liabilities.  This statement is related to 
Statement no. 63 in that it establishes accounting and financial reporting standards that reclassify, as deferred outflows of resources 
or deferred inflows of resources, certain items that were previously reported as assets and liabilities and recognizes, as outflows of 
resources or inflows of resources, certain items that were previously reported as assets and liabilities.   
  
In June 2012, the GASB issued Statement no. 68, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions.  The primary objective of this 
Statement is to improve accounting and financial reporting by state and local governments for pensions. It also improves information 
provided by state and local governmental employers about financial support for pensions that is provided by other entities.  
 
In June 2015, the GASB issued Statement no. 75, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other Than 
Pensions. This Statement revises existing standards for measuring and reporting retiree benefits provided by the University to its 
employees. 
 
In March 2016, the GASB issued Statement no. 81, Irrevocable Split-Interest Agreements. Although the effective date of the Stand-
ard is for fiscal year 2018, the University early implemented the requirements of the Standard in accounting for an irrevocable split-
interest agreement at the Jonesboro campus in fiscal year 2017. 
 
In May 2020, the GASB issued Statement no. 95, Postponement of the Effective Dates of Certain Authoritative Guidance.  This 
Statement postpones the following Statements that are relevant to the University due to the COVID-19 pandemic:  Statement no. 84 
Fiduciary Activities, Statement no. 89, Accounting for Interest Cost Incurred before the End of a Construction Period, and Statement 
no. 87, Leases. 
 
The University's financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2020 have been audited and Arkansas Legislative Audit has ren-
dered the audit opinion contained herein.  In accordance with Governmental Accounting Standards Board requirements this analysis 
includes a discussion of the significant changes between the two fiscal years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 where appropriate.  Due 
to the merger of the College of the Ouachitas (COTO) into the Arkansas State University System, the 2019 comparative amounts are 
shown separately for Arkansas State University and the College of the Ouachitas (now named Arkansas State University Three Riv-
ers).  The 2019 comparative amounts have been adjusted for the merger to provide a more complete comparison of the two years.   
Additional information about the merger may be found in Note 20. 

 
Statements Discussion 
 
Statement of Net Position 
The Statement of Net Position is intended to display the financial position of the University.  Its purpose is to present to the reader of 
the financial statements a benchmark from which to analyze the financial stability of the University.  It is a "snapshot" of the Univer-
sity's assets, liabilities, deferred inflows, deferred outflows, and net position (assets and deferred outflows minus liabilities and de-
ferred inflows) as of June 30, 2020, the last day of the fiscal year.  Assets and liabilities are presented in two categories: current and 
noncurrent.  Net position is presented in three categories: net investment in capital assets, restricted net position, and unrestricted net 
position.  Restricted net position is divided into two categories:  nonexpendable and expendable.  A more detailed explanation of 
these categories is found in the notes that accompany the financial statements.  A condensed version of the Statement of Net Position 
is displayed on the following page.

ARKANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM 
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (UNAUDITED) 

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2020 

 

Readers of the Statement of Net Position can determine answers to the following key questions as of June 30, 2020: 
  

 Did the University have sufficient assets available to meet its existing obligations and continue operations? 
  

 How much did the University owe to external parties including vendors and lending institutions? 
  

 What resources did the University have available to make future investments and expenditures? 
 

 
 
Assets and Deferred Outflows 
Total assets and deferred outflows increased by $2.3 million.   
  
Current Assets 
Current assets increased by $13.8 million.   
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents increased by approximately $72,000.  Although the overall total of cash and cash equivalents was trivial; 
the individual campuses had substantial swings.  The Jonesboro campus had a substantial decrease of $7 million.  This was mainly 
due to the federal drawdown of funds occurring after June 30

th
.  This amount was about $10 million.  This was offset by additional 

state appropriation received at the end of the year of $3 million.  All of the other campuses had increases for the year.  Beebe had a 
$4.1 million increase due to the maturity of certificates of deposits that were not reinvested.  Newport’s $2 million increase was also 
the result of the maturity of a certificate of deposit as well as receiving state appropriation funds at the end of the year.  The Three 
Rivers campus had a $592,000 increase due to the reduction of spending during the pandemic.  Mountain Home and Mid-South both 
had small increases in the amounts of $300,000 and $48,000, respectively.  
 
Short-term Investments 
Short-term investments decreased by $3.6 million.  This decrease was due to the maturity of certificate of deposits at the Beebe cam-
pus of $4.2 million.  Mountain Home purchased a $700,000 investment but also renewed a $2 million investment that matures in 24 
months and is shown as long-term.  Newport was the only campus to reflect an increase of $1.9 million due to renewing long-term 
investments to short term investments.  There were no changes at the other campuses.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (UNAUDITED) 

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2020 

 

Accounts Receivable 
Accounts receivable increased by approximately $17.7 million.  All campuses had increases.  Gross receivables increased by $17 
million.  The Jonesboro campus’s increase of $14.7 million was due to the federal drawdown of funds of approximately $10 million 
occurring after June 30

th
; as mentioned above in cash and cash equivalents.  In addition to this amount, the campus had recorded a 

receivable for the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act for reimbursement of expenses for roughly $1.8 
million.  Additionally, the campus had another $1.3 million for amounts due for construction, additional CARES funds, and the Doc-
tor of Osteopathic (DO) School agreement.   The Mid-South campus’s increase of $1.5 million was a result of Federal Pell Grants 
drawdown of approximately $840,000 that was not done for the spring term and CARES receivables in the amount of $800,000.  
Mountain Home and Newport also had increases totaling $1.1 million for CARES funds.  The Three Rivers campus showed an in-
crease due to a larger number of vendor accounts that were not paid at year end due to COVID.  The Beebe campus had a minimal 
increase in accounts receivable.  The campuses are continuing to monitor the accounts receivable balances and have increased collec-
tion activities.  This has proven to be an effective method as accounts receivables balances are closely monitored and the allowance 
for doubtful accounts methodology is reviewed and revised.  Overall, allowance for doubtful accounts decreased by about $764,000.  
Mid-South and Beebe both had large decreases.  Mid-South did a write-off of several old accounts and Beebe initiated a policy 
change of dropping for non-payment.   Mountain Home was the only campus to have an increase for allowance for doubtful accounts 
due to their change in bad debt policy.  Of the remaining campuses, Beebe had the largest decrease of $239,000 due to a change in 
policy for dropping for non-payments.  The other campuses had slight increases due to an increase of accounts receivable balances. 
 
Inventories 
Inventories decreased by $316,000.  Of the campuses with inventories, three had decreases and two had increases during the year.  
The highest change was the decrease at Jonesboro of $390,000.  This was a result of reduction of inventory related to the facilities 
management division.   The two campuses with increases, Newport and Three Rivers, both had increases in their bookstores due to 
both lower enrollment in the first summer term and the pandemic.  Beebe and Mid-South both had slight declines during the year. 
 
Deposits with Trustees 
Deposits with trustees increased slightly by $1,800.  All of the campuses, other than Mid-South, had decreases.  Mid-South’s in-
crease of about $13,000 is due to their bond agreements.  Jonesboro had a decrease of around $10,500 due to a bond refunding and 
the elimination of a debt service reserve fund on the refunded issue.  Additional information on the bond refunding may be found in 
Note 5.  The remaining campuses, other than Three Rivers, had slight decreases.  Three Rivers does not have bonds issued and had 
no deposits with trustees.   
 
Prepaid Expenses 
Prepaid expenses decreased slightly by nearly $8,700.  Of this amount, the Jonesboro campus experienced the biggest decrease in the 
amount of $46,000.  This was caused by a reductions in prepaid expenses for insurance, postage, and athletic travel.  Mid-South also 
had a decline of $27,000 due to the elimination of prepaid travel amounts.  Beebe showed a slight decrease due to an elimination of 
prepaid fuel vouchers by a program.  The remaining three campuses show increases for the fiscal year due to an increase in the 
amounts paid in fiscal year 2020 for fiscal year 2021 expenses.    
 
Capital Assets, net 
Capital assets, net decreased by $15.1 million.  Accumulated depreciation increased from $445,773,380 in 2019 to $471,287,152 in 
2020.  This increase, of approximately $25.5 million, is due to the recording of one additional year of depreciation for assets that 
have already been depreciating.  Additionally, there was new equipment, new buildings, renovations to buildings, and other improve-
ments/infrastructure that were added in 2019 and began depreciating in 2020.  The increase in accumulated depreciation was offset 
by the addition of $12.7 million in capital assets and the retirement of $2.3 million in capital assets with accumulated depreciation of 
$1.6 million.  Of the $12.7 million added to capital assets, $3.7 million was construction in progress, $4.6 was improvements and 
infrastructure, and $3.2 million was equipment.  Additional information about capital assets may be found in the ‘Capital Assets’ 
section of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis. 
 
Other Noncurrent Assets 
Other noncurrent assets increased by $5.7 million.   
 
Noncurrent Cash 
Noncurrent cash increased by $8 million while restricted cash decreased by $170,000.  The Jonesboro and Mountain Home campus-
es are the only campus to have a noncurrent cash balance.  At Jonesboro, the increase in noncurrent cash of $6.7 million was a result 
of additional cash transfers to unexpended plant funds and the accounts receivable related to CARES and a construction project.  The 
annual increase of noncurrent cash by the campus is a strategic effort to increase the University’s reserves. The change for Mountain 
Home was moving cash from restricted to noncurrent cash.  The largest portion of the increase in restricted cash was mostly due to 
the Mid-South campus.  Mid-South had an increase for the receipt of restricted cash from their excess millage during fiscal year 
2020.  The remaining increases in restricted cash were due to the Perkins loan fund at the Jonesboro campus.  The decrease was a 
result of moving the cash from restricted to noncurrent at the Mountain Home campus.  
 
Endowment Investments 
Endowment investments decreased slightly by $274,000.  This was due to a decrease in the return rate of the investments compared 
to previous years.

Other Long-term Investments 
Other long-term investments decreased by $2.3 million.  Jonesboro and Newport both had decreases.   At Jonesboro, as the invest-
ments are maturing; new investments are not being bought.  There is a strategic change to move from investments to cash.  There 
was a decrease of $3.2 million for the year.  At Newport, their investment activity has changed from other long-term investments to 
short-term, noncurrent restricted, and noncurrent unrestricted.  The increases at Beebe, Mid-South, and Mountain Home are a result 
of moving from short-term to long-term investments.  Their combined increases totaled $4.7 million. 
 
Irrevocable Split-Interest Agreement 
The Jonesboro campus early implemented GASB no. 81, Irrevocable Split-Interest Agreements, which was effective July 1, 2017 
during fiscal year 2017.  There was an increase of roughly $20,000 during fiscal year 2020 as the trustee re-appraised the value of the 
asset. 
 
Deposits with Trustees 
Deposits with trustees decreased slightly by $218,000.  The Jonesboro campus’s decrease of $280,000 was primarily due to the elim-
ination of a debt service reserve fund related to the bond refunding issue.  Additional information on the bond refunding may be 
found in Note 5.  Mid-South’s increase for the year was due to their bond agreements.  
 
Deferred Outflows  
Deferred outflows decreased by approximately $2.1 million.  Roughly $1.3 million of this decrease was due to an increased amount 
of deferred outflows related to pensions.  All of the campuses had decreases due to the adjustment of deferred outflows related to 
pensions for the 2020 fiscal year.  Additional information about the deferred outflows related to pensions may be found in Note 8 
and the Required Supplementary Information.  Deferred outflows related to other postemployment benefits (OPEB) declined by 
about $711,000.  All of the campuses, other than Three Rivers, recorded increases for these in accordance with GASB no. 75.  Three 
Rivers had a slight increase of around $23,000.  Additional information about the deferred outflows related to OPEB may be found 
in Note 12 and the Required Supplementary Information.  Deferred outflows related to the excess of bond reacquisition costs over 
carrying value decreased by $82,000.  All the campuses, other than Mountain Home, had decreases due to the amortization of these 
amounts.  Jonesboro and Mountain Home both recorded additional amounts for their bond refunding issues.  Mountain Home 
showed an increase overall in this amount of around $47,000; however; Jonesboro still showed a decrease of nearly $74,000 due to 
the amount of amortization exceeding the amount of the new issue being added and the refunded issue being removed.  Additional 
information about the bond issue may be found in the ‘Debt Admin-
istration’ section of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis and 
Note 5.   
 
Liabilities and Deferred Inflows 
Total liabilities and deferred inflows decreased by $19.9 million. 
 
Current Liabilities 
Current liabilities decreased by $1.9 million.   
 
Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities 
Accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased slightly by $1 mil-
lion.  Jonesboro had the largest decrease of $1.2 million.  This decrease 
was a result of the pandemic and resulted in lower travel reimburse-
ments due to the freezing of travel and reductions in spending by de-
partments.  The departments managed their budgets effectively and 
lowered spending during the latter part of the fiscal year.  The campus 
moved to online instruction the latter part of the spring term as well as 
the first summer term.  Additionally, most staff began working from 
home during the latter part of March through the middle of July.  New-
port and Three Rivers also had decreases; while Beebe, Mid-South, and 
Mountain Home had slight increases. 
 
Bonds, Notes, and Leases Payable 
Bonds, notes, and leases payable increased slightly by $518,000.  All of 
the campuses had increases.  There were no additional debt issued dur-
ing the fiscal year; however Jonesboro and Mountain Home did have 
bond refunding issues.  The increases for each campus is due to the 
additional amount of principal payments due in 2021 compared to 
2020.   
 
Unearned Revenues 
Unearned revenues decreased by $1.5 million.  This was due to 
amounts received for tuition and fee for the second summer term and/or 
fall term that were recorded as unearned revenue at the end of 2020.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2020 

 

Furthermore, this is a result of grant awards received in full prior to the spending of the total grant award.   As expenses are posted to 
the grant award; revenue is recognized equal to the amount of the expenses.  At the Jonesboro campus, there was a variance of $1.4 
million from 2019 to 2020.  This decline was mainly due to a large amount of unearned revenue being recognized during fiscal year 
2020.  Mountain Home and Three Rivers had slight increases totaling $12,500 related to grants.  The remaining amount of the de-
cline of unearned revenue was related to tuition and fee decreases.   
 
Deposits 
Deposits increased by $141,000.  The majority of this decrease was due to more students prepaying for the second summer and fall 
terms at Mountain Home.  At Jonesboro, deposits for international students are allocated between current and noncurrent based on 
historical data.  Although deposits decreased overall at the campus, the current amount increased due to the allocation.  Beebe had a 
slight increase due to property rental.  
 
Other Postemployment Benefits (OPEB) Liability 
The current portion of this liability, a reduction of about $414,000, was recorded during the year in accordance with GASB no. 75.  
The current portion of this total liability represents the amount that is the expected employer contributions for fiscal year 2021.  Ad-
ditional information about OPEB may be found in Note 12 and the Required Supplementary Information. 
 
Noncurrent Liabilities 
Noncurrent liabilities decreased by $25 million.   
 
Bonds, Notes, and Leases Payable 
Bonds, notes and leases payable decreased by $12 million.  All campuses had decreases when compared to 2019.  There was no new 
debt recorded in 2020.  The decrease is a reflection of the reduction of principal amounts owed by all the campuses for bonds, notes, 
and leases payable.  
 
Other Postemployment Benefits (OPEB) Liability 
The noncurrent portion of this liability decreased by about $12.7 million and was recorded during the year in accordance with GASB 
no. 75.  Additional information may be found about OPEB may be found below in the deferred inflows section, in Note 12 and the 
Required Supplementary Information. 
 
Net Pension Liability 
The University’s portion of the net pension liability decreased by around $48,000.   These amounts were recorded in accordance with 
GASB no. 68.  Additional information about the net pension liability may be found in Note 8 as well as the Required Supplementary 
Information. 
 
Deferred Inflows 
Deferred inflows increased by $7 million.  Nearly all of this increase, $8.5 million, was the amount related to other postemployment 
benefits.  This amount is recorded in accordance with GASB no. 75. and as mentioned previously, the campuses recorded a large 
decrease of $12.7 million related to the noncurrent liability portion of OPEB.  The overall effect of recording the OPEB amounts 
showed an increase of $3.9 million.  The largest overall increase was for Three Rivers in the amount of $4.9 million due to their mer-
ger with the Arkansas State University System and joining the System’s OPEB plan.  In addition to OPEB, there was a $1.5 million 
decrease for pensions which was recognized in fiscal year 2020 in accordance with GASB no. 68.  The deferred inflows are recorded 
in conjunction with the deferred outflows and net pension liability discussed previously.  The remaining minimal increase of $20,000 
was recorded as part of the irrevocable split-interest agreement at the Jonesboro campus as previously mentioned in the Noncurrent 
Asset section.

Net Investment in Capital Assets 
Net investment in capital assets decreased by $3.8 million.  This decrease was mainly attributable to recognition of depreciation ex-
pense at all of the campuses.  In previous years, there have been large increases of construction projects, primarily at the Jonesboro 
campus, to offset the amount of depreciation recognized.  For 2020, there was $12.7 million in capital assets additions compared to 
$27 million of depreciation expense. 
  
Restricted, Nonexpendable 
Restricted, nonexpendable net position decreased by $431,000. 
 

 Scholarships and Fellowships—Restricted, nonexpendable net position for scholarships and fellowships decreased by $185,000.  
This was due to the Jonesboro campus’s decrease and the Beebe campus’s slight increase in the market value of endowment 
investments held by the ASU Foundation for scholarship purposes.   

 

 Renewal and Replacement—The Mid-South campus has restricted, nonexpendable net position for renewal and replacement.  
There were no changes to the net position during the fiscal year.   

  

 Loans—The restricted, nonexpendable net position for loans decreased in the amount of approximately $185,000.  This was due to 
the federal government requiring a reimbursement of funds related to the Federal Perkins Loan Program during fiscal year 2020.  
This amount will continue to decrease as the Federal Perkins Loan Program expired on September 30, 2017. 

  

 Other—Restricted, nonexpendable net position for other purposes than those mentioned above decreased by about $62,000.  This 
was due to decrease in investment earnings during the year on endowments for purposes other than scholarships.  

 
Restricted, Expendable 
Restricted, expendable net position increased by $3.5 million. 
 

 Scholarships and Fellowships—Restricted, expendable net position for scholarships and fellowships increased by $529,000.  This 
increase was mostly attributable to around $369,000 being posted as a receivable for the Arkansas Challenge Lottery.  Addition-
ally, the Jonesboro campus received funds in the amount of about $107,000 from the Kays Trust.  These are amounts that would 
typically be spent during the fiscal year but were not able to be expended for student scholarships in the spring due to COVID.   

 

 Research—Restricted, expendable net position for research increased by $150,000.  This slight increase is due to year end balances 
of restricted grants for research purposes at the Jonesboro campus.

 Loans—The restricted, expendable net position for loans did not change for fiscal year 2020.  Mid-South is the only campus to 
have a restricted, expendable net position amount for loans. 

  

 Debt Service—The restricted, expendable net position for other purposes than those listed above decreased slightly by $7,200.  The 
Mid-South campus is the only campus to have funds restricted for debt service due to their debt structure for bonds payable. 

 

 Renewal and Replacement—The Mid-South campus has restricted, expendable net position for renewal and replacement.  There 
was an increase of $78,000 due to the bond requirements of these funds.   

 

 Other—The restricted, expendable net position for other purposes than those listed above increased by $2.8 million.  Campuses, 
other than Beebe and Mid-South, experienced declines.  Three Rivers does not have a balance for this.  The increase of about 
$1.5 million at Jonesboro were related to an increase of non-research grant activity balances at year end and the receipt of an 
athletic gift of $319,000.  The remaining increases were due to the CARES funds.  Mid-South showed a decrease of $101,000 
due to a decrease in the expenses related to Southland.  The decrease for Beebe was minimal. 

  
Unrestricted 
Unrestricted net position increased by $22.9 million.  While the CARES Act attributed to a great deal of the increases; the campuses 
also showed increases due to reduced spending and efforts to increase reserves.  The majority of this increase was a $10.1 million 
increase at the Jonesboro campus due to an increased effort to grow the University’s reserves balance.  In addition, Beebe’s unre-
stricted net position also increased by approximately $1.6 million.  Mid-South had an increase of $3.1 million.  In addition to the 
items mentioned previously; they also saw an increase in their excess millage by $1.1 million.   Mountain Home and Newport had 
increases of $1 million and $1.3 million, respectively.  Three River’s showed an increase of $5.6 million while some of this can be 
attributed to the above explanations; their increase is largely a result of the merger with the Arkansas State University System.  At 
the end of fiscal year 2019, the campus showed a negative amount of net position of $3.9 million.  This was due to the campus’s 
amount of OPEB that had been recorded.  Due to the merger, the campus amount of OPEB was decreased and they now show a posi-
tive amount of nearly $1.8 million.

ARKANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM 
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (UNAUDITED) 

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2020 

 

Statement of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Position 
The net position as presented on the Statement of Net Position is based in part on the financial activities that occurred during the 
fiscal year as presented in the Statement of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Position.  This statement's purpose is to present 
the revenues generated and received by the University, both operating and nonoperating, the expenses incurred by the University, 
both operating and nonoperating, and all other financial gains or losses experienced by the University during the fiscal year ended 
June 30, 2020. 
  
Generally, revenues from operations are received in exchange for the University providing services or products to students and other 
constituencies.  Operating expenses are those costs paid or incurred in producing those services or products or in carrying out the 
mission of the University.  Nonoperating revenues are financial inflows to the University resulting from nonexchange transactions; 
that is, the University does not provide a specific service or product in exchange for them.  For example, appropriations from the 
state are considered nonoperating revenue because the legislature does not receive a direct and commensurate benefit from the Uni-
versity in exchange for providing the appropriation.  A condensed Statement of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Position 
for fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 is shown below. 

 
Revenues 
Total revenues increased by approximately $13.4 million.   
  
Operating Revenues 
Total operating revenues decreased by $1.4 million. 
  
Tuition and Fees, net 
Net tuition and fees decreased a bit by approximately $650,000.  Gross tuition and fee revenue decreased by $1.8 million.  The cam-
puses had modest increases in tuition and fee charges from 2019 to 2020.  Beebe, Mountain Home, Newport, and Three Rivers all 
had decreases of net tuition and fee revenue.  The largest decrease was $1 million at Beebe; the remaining campuses had a combined 
decrease of $750,000.  All campuses experienced lower enrollment when comparing 2019 to 2020.  Although enrollment declined,

both Jonesboro and Mid-South managed to have slight increases in net tuition and fee revenue in the combined amount of $1.1 mil-
lion.  Toward the end of the fiscal year; the campuses also suffered due to the COVID pandemic as classes were moved to online.  
The decrease in tuition and fee revenue also led to a decrease in scholarship allowances.  Scholarship allowances decreased by $1 
million.   
 
Grants and Contracts 
Operating grants and contracts increased very slightly by $437,000.  Jonesboro, Mid-South, Mountain Home, and Newport all expe-
rienced increases in operating grants and contracts revenues due to slight increases of these balances at the end of the year.  Overall, 
the change across the campuses was an increase of 1.23%.  As the available grant resources continue to decline; there will continue 
to be fluctuations in the amount of operating grants and contracts revenue as more colleges and universities compete for these dol-
lars.  Additionally, timing issues of receipts and expenses also plays a role in the ending balances for grants and contracts. 
  
Sales and Services 
Sales and services decreased by $662,000.  This decrease is a direct result of the COVID pandemic as the campuses lost revenue due 
to cancelled events, lost store sales, and reduced admissions due to closed facilities.  All of the campuses that show sales and services 
income showed reductions.  These include Jonesboro, Beebe, and Mountain Home.  Additionally, the operation of the Health Center 
at the Jonesboro campus was moved on January 1 to the NYIT (New York Institute of Technology) location on campus.  
 
Auxiliary Enterprises, net 
Auxiliary enterprises, net decreased by approximately $2.8 million.  All campuses, other than Newport, experienced declines from 
2019 to 2020.  The Jonesboro campus experienced the largest decrease of $2.2 million.  The decreases in auxiliary revenues at the 
campuses were expected due to the declines in enrollment and the pandemic.  In addition to the reduced revenues, scholarship allow-
ances related to auxiliaries decreased slightly by $73,000.   
  
Self Insurance 
Self insurance revenues increased by $809,000.  During fiscal year 2020, there was a minimal increase in premiums beginning in 
January 2020 for the employee withholding amount.   
  
Other 
Other operating revenues increased by $1.4 million; although Jonesboro and Three Rivers were the only campuses with increases.  
The largest increase was $1.9 million at the Jonesboro campus for the partner share of the NYIT College of Osteopathic Medicine 
location on campus.  The increase at Three Rivers was a result of a reclassification of rental income.  The reductions for the year 
included the variance of energy rebates that had been received as one-time payments in 2019 for Beebe and Newport.   Mountain 
Home also showed a decrease due to receiving one-time funds in 2019 for phone company refunds and payments received from the 
academic excellence trust.

Federal Appropriations 
Federal appropriations decreased by about $77,000.  In prior fiscal years, the Jonesboro campus received several federal awards re-
lated to grants and contracts.  These amounts continue to decrease as available grant resources continue to decline.  In 2020, there 
were two grant awards compared to three in 2019. 
  
State Appropriations 
State appropriations decreased by approximately $257,000; although Beebe was the only campus with a decrease.  Their decrease 
was about $894,000 and is a nearly a 6% loss from 2019.  The other campuses had increases during the year due to general appropri-
ation funding adjustments ranging from 0.19% to 3.46%.  The Three Rivers campus had the lowest increase of $31,000 and Newport 
had the highest at $285,000. These ranges are an effect of the productivity-based funding model used.  Act 148 of 2017 repealed the 
needs-based and outcome-centered funding and directed the Arkansas Higher Education Coordinating Board to adopt policies devel-
oped by the Department of Higher Education (ADHE) necessary to implement a productivity-based funding model for state-
supported institutions of higher education.  Productivity-based funding is a mechanism to align institutional funding with statewide 
priorities for higher education by incentivizing progress toward statewide goals. At the same time, such models encourage accounta-
bility to students and policymakers by focusing on the success of students through the achievement of their educational goals. The 
new funding model is built around a set of shared principles developed by institutions and aligned with goals and objectives for post-
secondary attainment in the state.   
  
Grants and Contracts 
Nonoperating grants and contracts decreased by $2 million.  There was a decrease of $2.2 million on the Jonesboro campus.  Both 
federal and state financial aid declined during the year in the amounts of $1.8 million and $400,000, respectively.  Also, Mid-South 
and Three Rivers had combined decreases of $247,000.  The other campuses had small increases during the year.  
 
CARES Grants-Related to COVID-19 
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act or, CARES Act, was passed by Congress and signed by President Donald 
Trump on March 27th, 2020. This bill allotted $2.2 trillion to provide fast and direct economic aid to the American people negatively 
impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Of that money, approximately $14 billion was given to the Office of Postsecondary Educa-
tion as the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund, or HEERF.  The campuses recorded almost $15.1 million related to this.  A 
portion of these funds (the student portion) stipulated that the amount would be used to provide emergency grants to students.  Once 
those funds had been expended; the institution may then receive the institutional portion of HEERF.  The total HEERF award for the 
student portion and the institutional portion were equal awards to institutions.  Additionally, the campuses qualified for SIP

(Strengthening Institutions Program) funds.  Both the institutional portion of HEERF and the SIP awards were used to provide relief 
to intuitions for reimbursement items such as, room and board refunds to students, purchases of equipment related to moving to 
online learning, and additional emergency payments to students. 
  
Sales and Use Taxes 
Sales and use taxes increased a bit by $117,000.   Beebe saw an increase of $123,000 and Newport experienced a decrease of $6,000.  
 
Property Taxes 
Property tax revenues increased by $143,000 overall.  On the Mid-South campus this increase was $108,000 and on the Mountain 
Home campus $35,000.   
  
Gifts 
Revenues from gifts decreased by $202,000.  All the campuses experienced declines compared to 2019.  Mid-South had the largest 
decrease of $112,000 mainly due to a reductions in gifts for scholarships. 
 
Investment Income 
Investment income decreased by $1.2 million.  Jonesboro had the highest decrease of $1.2 million.  This was a result of lower invest-
ment income in the endowment and bond funds.  Beebe was the only other campus with a decline due to a decrease in interest rates.  
The other campuses showed increases due to having additional investments and for Mid-South, an increase in their excess millage.   
 
Expenses 
Total expenses increased by $3.2 million.   
  
Operating Expenses 
Total operating expenses increased by $3.6 million.

Personal Services 
Personal services decreased by approximately $2.2 million.  The Three-Rivers campus experienced the largest decrease, $5.1 mil-
lion.  The majority of this decrease was to their OPEB plan.  The campus joined the System’s OPEB plan as previously mentioned.  
This provided the campus with a positive effect in recording OPEB plan liabilities from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020.  Addi-
tionally, the remaining campuses (other than Jonesboro), had a combined decrease of $1.1 million.  The Jonesboro campus did mini-
mal salary increases from 2019 to 2020.  This and the effect of the OPEB liability caused a $4 million increase in the campus’s per-
sonal services.  A net amount of $1 million was recorded by the campuses for other postemployment benefits; other than Three Riv-

 ers.  The Three Rivers campus recorded a reduction of $4.9 million.  More information on this may be found in Note 12.   
  
Scholarships and Fellowships 
Scholarships and fellowships decreased by $350,000.  As previously discussed, there was a decrease in scholarship allowances relat-
ed to tuition and fees and a decrease in scholarship allowances related to auxiliaries.  Gross scholarships and fellowships decreased 
by $1.4 million.  All of the campuses had declines in enrollment when compared to 2019.  Although federal and state financial aid 
fluctuates throughout the years; the campuses continue to offer competitive institutional scholarships to students.  The institutional 
scholarships continue to increase at each campus and displays the University’s commitment to students. 
  
Supplies and Services 
Supplies and services increased by $4.5 million.  With the exception of a $5.5 million increase at the Jonesboro campus, all other 
campuses experienced a decrease of expenses for supplies and services.  The Jonesboro campus’s increase was a result of the 
CARES direct payments to students (as detailed in the CARES Grants-Related to COVID-19 section previously).  The direct amount 
of student payments totaled approximately $4.6 million.  This was the full amount of the student portion of the HEERF award.  
While the campus had reductions in travel and supplies expenses during the latter part of the fiscal year; there was an increase in 
expenses to prepare classrooms and other areas for online and socially distanced learning.  The remaining campuses had a combined 
decrease of about $1 million.  These decreases were also a result of lower costs due to the pandemic.  Some of these campuses also 
have not expended their full amount of the student portion of the HEERF award as of June 30.  The campuses continue to be com-
mitted to cost containment efforts and pursue conservative levels of spending.   
 
Self Insurance 
Self insurance expenses decreased by $883,000.  Medical claims during 2020 decreased minimally when compared to 2019.  Addi-
tionally, there was a very slight increase ($31,000) in the unpaid claims liability recorded at year end.   
 
Depreciation 
Depreciation expense increased by $2.6 million.  All of the campuses, other than Mid-South, experienced increases when compared 
to 2019.  The amount of their decrease was about $67,000.  The increases at the other campuses were a result of new additions or 
renovations at the campuses that were added in 2019 and began depreciating in 2020.  Additionally, as new projects were completed 
in 2020, depreciation expense will increase next year as a result of these.  The amount of completed projects was $12.7 million when 
compared to the $11.4 million in 2019; depreciation expense will continue to increase each year as new buildings and renovations 
are completed and begin depreciating.   
 
Other 
Other operating expenses decreased by $3,800.  These expenses are related to the Federal Perkins Loan program on the Jonesboro 
campus.

Nonoperating Expenses 
Total nonoperating expenses decreased by $355,000.   
  
Interest 
Interest expense decreased by $594,000.  While all the campuses showed decreases; Jonesboro experienced the largest decrease of 
$414,000.  The campuses did not incur any new debt during fiscal year 2020.  There were two bond refunding issues at Jonesboro 
and one bond refunding issue at Mountain Home.  The lower interest expense is expected due to no additional debt with interest be-
ing added and the fact that more of the payments are being applied to principal rather than interest.  Additional information on debt 
administration may be found in the Debt Administration section that follows. 
  
Gain or Loss on Disposal of Capital Assets 
During the fiscal year, the University had a loss of $397,000 on capital assets compared to a loss of $243,000 in fiscal year 2019.  
The Jonesboro campus had a loss of about $390,000.  This was mainly a result of disposing of renovated space for the IT Store that 
was not fully depreciated.  The area is now part of the space that NYIT uses for the DO School.  Additionally, Mid-South also dis-
posed of an asset that was not fully depreciated which accounted for their loss of $8,500.  Newport was the only campus to show a 
gain of about $1,100. 
 
Other Changes 
Other revenues, expenses, gains and losses totaled $236,000.  This amount decreased by $551,000.   
  
Capital Appropriations 
Capital appropriations increased by $19,000.  The Jonesboro campus was the only campus with capital appropriations in 2019 as 
well as 2020.  In 2020, the campus received around $77,200 for projects for the Lakeport Plantation Dairy and the Dyess Colony.  
These are funds received that are related to the campus’s Delta Heritage Office.  The remaining funds received in 2020 were related 
to Marion Berry Phase III-Loop Road. This was the final payment on the project is nearing completion and the campus received 
about $44,000 less than in 2019.  
  
Capital Grants and Gifts 
Capital grants and gifts decreased by $661,000.  The Jonesboro campus had a decline of $676,000 compared to fiscal year 2019.  
This was mainly due to the capital gift of the marquee being added in 2019 in the amount of $690,000.  Beebe, Mid-South, Mountain 
Home, and Newport also had decreases when compared to 2019.  Three Rivers had an increase of $150,000 due to a building and 
land received during the year.   
 
Statement of Cash Flows 
The third and final statement presented is the Statement of Cash Flows.  This statement presents detailed information about the Uni-
versity's financial activities from the perspective of their effect on cash.  The information is presented in five components.  The first 
presents cash inflows and outflows resulting from the University's normal operating activities.  The second component presents cash 
flows from noncapital financing activities; that is, cash received from or spent for activities that do not result from normal opera-
tions, capital financing activities, or investing.   The third component presents cash inflows and outflows resulting from capital and 
related financing activities such as debt issuance, lease agreements, and capital appropriations, grants, or gifts.  The fourth compo-
nent presents cash flows resulting from investing activities such as purchases and liquidations of investments and interest, gains, and 
losses generated by these activities.  The fifth component of the Statement of Cash Flows is a reconciliation of the net operating rev-
enues (expenses) for the fiscal year as reported on the Statement of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Position to the net cash 
provided (used) by operating activities as presented in component one of the Statement of Cash Flows.

Capital Assets 
 

Capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation, at June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019 were as follows: 

 
Land 
The University had two additions of land and land improvements in the amounts of $41,875 at the Newport campus and $13,500 at 
the Three Rivers campus during fiscal year 2020.  The land addition at Three Rivers was a capital gift received during the year. 
  
Construction in progress 
Construction in progress increased by 32.59%.  This increase is mainly attributable to several renovation projects at the Jonesboro 
campus.  Jonesboro had an increase of $2.4 million.  Some of these projects include renovations to the library and student union and 
campus lighting improvements.  Additionally, Mountain Home had a slight increase while the other campuses either reduced their 
construction in progress or had none during 2020.  
  
Livestock 
The change of 7.58% is attributable to an increase of the Jonesboro campus livestock herds of $12,613 and a slight increase of the 
Beebe campus’s herds in the amount of $3,937. 
 
Intangibles-Software in development 
The Beebe, Mountain Home and Newport campuses have been implementing a new ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) System.  
The new software was still in development as of June 30, 2019 for the Newport campus.  The University’s threshold for capitalizing 
software is $1 million and Newport campus completed $1,709,844 and this amount was transferred to intangibles-software during 
2020.  The Jonesboro campus has been transitioning to cloud software and currently has $847,761 of intangibles-software in devel-
opment.  
  
Intangibles-Easements 
The University had no additions or disposals of easements during fiscal year 2020. 
 
Intangibles-Software 
The University’s increase of $883,418 consisted of the amount that the Newport campus transferred from intangibles-software in 
development.  In addition, $826,426 was depreciated for software during fiscal year 2020.  
 
Buildings 
The University experienced a decrease of $11.2 million in the total value of buildings.  This is a result of additional depreciation rec-
orded during the year.  In fiscal year 2020, the campuses added $257,987 compared to $507,614 in fiscal year 2019.  Although this 
amount was higher than in 2019; the amount of depreciation far exceeded the amount of building additions.  The Jonesboro and 
Three Rivers campuses were the only campuses with building additions during the year.  The Jonesboro campus added $121,487 in 
building additions for a pavilion but also removed several houses that were fully depreciated for the construction of an art studio.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (UNAUDITED) 

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2020 

 

Three Rivers had an addition of $136,500 in buildings due to a capital gift received during the year.  Also, accumulated depreciation 
increased from $298,722,574 in 2019 to $310,056,494 in 2020.  This is due to the annual amount of depreciation recorded by each 
campus.  There were no large adjustments since the additions of buildings in the prior year were minor.   
 
Improvements and infrastructure 
The 2.78%, or $4,050,730, decrease in improvements and infrastructure is attributable to the amount of depreciation exceeding the 
amount of additions during the year.  In 2019, there were several projects that were completed totaling approximately $16.4 million.  
These included $10.5 million related to energy performance improvements at the Beebe, Mid-South, and Newport campuses and 
$5.9 million at the Jonesboro campus for various projects as well as the addition of a capital gift of a marquee.  In fiscal year 2020, 
there were only $6.4 million in additions.  The Jonesboro campus had the largest amount of additions totaling approximately $5.2 
million.  The largest project was the addition of $3.5 million in improvements to the cafeteria located in the student union.  This was 
a project completed by the campus’s food services provider at no cost to the campus in exchange for the campus foregoing the re-
maining investment funds for the remainder of the project.  Additionally, the campus completed several renovations such as parking 
and residence hall improvements.  In addition to a reduced amount of completed projects; the amount of depreciation increased in the 
fiscal year 2020 due to the additions in fiscal year 2019.  In 2019, there was $7.7 million posted for depreciation compared to $10.1 
million in 2020.  Also, the deletions in 2019 were nearly fully depreciated while the 2020 deletions netted to around $409,000.  
  
Equipment 
Equipment decreased by 8.62%, or $1,273,728, during the year.  Equipment additions decreased from $4,024,738 in 2019 to 
$3,308,868 in 2020.  Of the additions for fiscal year 2020, $151,526 were capital gifts received by the campuses and noted on the 
Cash Flow Statement as a noncash transaction.  Equipment purchases decreased by about $716,000.  The campuses did have reduced 
spending in light of the COVID pandemic.  Depreciation expense increased from $4,439,663 in 2019 to $4,547,063 in 2020.  The 
campuses disposed of equipment during the year with a net value of $35,533.   
  
Library/audiovisual holdings 
The University’s decrease of $69,884, or 4.85%, is due to the amount of depreciation exceeding the amount of purchases during the 
year.  Total purchases declined in part to the COVID pandemic during the last part of the fiscal year from a total of $118,700 com-
pared to $143,492 in 2019.  Depreciation expense decreased from $220,619 in 2019 to $188,584 in 2020.  Library holdings that were 
removed during the year were fully depreciated.   
 
 Additional information on capital assets by campus may be found in Note 4 in the notes to the financial statements.

ARKANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM 
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (UNAUDITED) 

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2020 

 

Debt Administration 
 
The University’s financial statements indicate $175,936,217 in bonds payable, $9,815,080 in notes payable and $22,326,301 in capi-
tal leases payable at June 30, 2020. 
  
The Jonesboro and Mountain Home campuses issued refunding bonds during 2020.  The bonds that were refunded included: 
 
  Jonesboro  $1,605,000 2010A Refunding 
  Jonesboro  $3,905,000 2012C Taxable Housing 
  Mountain Home  $4,785,000 2012 Refunding 
 
Additional information about the refunding is included in Note 5. 
 
The University’s bonded indebtedness consists of revenue bonds secured by tuition and fees, property taxes, and auxiliary revenues, 
such as housing and parking fees.  The revenue bonds were issued for educational buildings, student housing, parking improvements, 
property purchases, plant improvements, and auxiliary facilities.   
  
The $9,815,080 in notes payable consists of five notes for the Jonesboro campus.  These include an $8,000,000 note to renovate Wil-
son Hall for the DO School, $604,000 and $600,000 notes for energy improvement projects through the state’s sustainable revolving 
loan fund, and a $1,000,000 note for pedestrian improvements.  Additionally, there is a $1,000,000 note for renovations to the Ar-
mory.  The campus has benefited from securing zero or very low interest rates for each of these notes.  At June 30, 2020, the out-
standing amounts for these notes were $3,748,321, $332,200, $330,000, $402,879, and $800,000 respectively.  The Newport campus 
has $829,439 in notes payable for the construction of a Hospitality Building at the ASU-Newport Jonesboro campus location.  The 
Beebe, Mid-South, and Newport campuses have notes payable related to their energy performance improvements and are paid with 
savings from utility billings.  These amounts at the end of 2020 are $87,767, $1,424,700, and $877,674, respectively.  The notes pay-
able for the Three Rivers campus include $825,000 for construction of a new Allied Health building, $565,000 for the remodel and 
expansion of a cosmetology building, , and $1,000,000 for the purchase and renovation of an Applied Science Technology build-
ing.  All three notes were secured through Arkansas Higher Education Coordinating Boards’ College Savings Bond Revolving Loan 
Fund at exceptionally low interest rates. The outstanding amounts for these notes were $148,027, $229,763 and $604,310 respective-
ly. 
  
The Jonesboro campus issued a capital lease during 2016 in the amount of $15,226,080 for energy savings projects on the campus.  
The savings from utility billings will be used to pay the debt.  Principal payments began in 2019 and the current balance of the debt 
is $14,585,346.  The Newport campus issued a capital lease during 2017 for IT equipment.  The amount of the lease is $606,934 and 
a balance of $121,387 remains at June 30, 2020.  The Beebe and Newport campuses added leases payable in the amounts of 
$4,930,498 and $2,951,079, respectively, during fiscal year 2018.  Both of these leases payable were for energy performance im-
provements and will be paid with savings from utility billings.  These balances are $4,766,593 and $2,852,975, respectively at June 
30, 2020. 
 
Additional information on the University’s debt may be found in Notes 5, 6 and 15 in the notes to the financial statements. 
  

Economic Outlook 
 
On March 11, 2020, the Governor of Arkansas issued Executive Order 20-03 declaring an emergency and ordered the Arkansas De-
partment of Health to take action to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The extent of the impact of COVID
-19 on our financial statements for future reporting periods will depend on certain developments, including the duration and speed of 
the outbreak and revenue collections – all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted.  However, the economic outlook of the 
University remains sound at this time. 
 
At the state level, the economy is stable, and revenues are tracking above forecast levels.  Arkansas continues to conservatively man-
age its financial resources; as a result, state appropriations to the University have remained static with no expectation of appreciable 
increases in the near term.  Public higher education will continue to compete with other state agencies and priorities for appropriate 
levels of funding.    
 
Act 148 of 2017 repealed the needs-based and outcome-centered funding and directed the Arkansas Higher Education Coordinating 
Board to adopt policies developed by the Department of Higher Education (ADHE) necessary to implement a productivity-based 
funding model for state-supported institutions of higher education.  Productivity-based funding is a mechanism to align institutional 
funding with statewide priorities for higher education by incentivizing progress toward statewide goals. At the same time, such mod-
els encourage accountability to students and policymakers by focusing on the success of students through the achievement of their 
educational goals. The new funding model is built around a set of shared principles developed by institutions and aligned with goals 
and objectives for post-secondary attainment in the state.   
 
The University continues to maintain a strong credit rating of A1by Moody’s Investors Service.  Achieving and maintaining this 



34  

 

credit ratings provides the University with significant flexibility in securing capital funds on the most competitive terms. This flexi-
bility, along with ongoing efforts toward revenue diversification and cost containment, will enable the University to provide the nec-
essary resources to support a consistent level of excellence in service to students, the local communities, the state and the nation. 
    
The University continues to proactively manage its enrollment and scholarship administration to strike an appropriate balance be-
tween academic standards, demographic and economic changes, and net tuition revenue.  The University continues to review all of 
its existing and potential revenue sources and is working to explore and develop new and innovative funding opportunities.

NOTE 1. 
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

 
Reporting Entity   
Jonesboro 
Arkansas State University-Jonesboro, an Institution of Higher Edu-
cation of the State of Arkansas, developed from one of four State 
agricultural schools established in 1909 by an act of the Arkansas 
General Assembly.  The University opened as a vocational high 
school in 1910 and was reorganized as a junior college in 1918.  
The name was changed to State Agricultural and Mechanical Col-
lege by an act of the Legislature in 1925.  Authority to extend the 
curriculum, offer senior college work, and grant degrees was grant-
ed in 1931.  In 1933, the Legislature changed the name of the Col-
lege to Arkansas State College.  Master-level programs were begun 
in 1955.  In January 1967, the Legislature passed an act authorizing 
a change in the name of Arkansas State College to Arkansas State 
University, effective July 1, 1967.  The University’s first doctoral 
degree in Educational Leadership was awarded in 1992. 
 
Beebe 
Arkansas State University-Beebe began in 1927 as Junior Agricul-
tural School of Central Arkansas.  In 1955, the Arkansas General 
Assembly designated the school a campus of Arkansas State Col-
lege.   The branch campus was designated as Arkansas State Col-
lege-Beebe Branch.  The institution established a campus at the 
Little Rock Air Force Base in 1965.  The campus became Arkansas 
State University-Beebe in 1967.   Act 90 of 2001 eliminated the 
word “branch” from the references to campuses of Arkansas State 
University. 
 
ASU-Heber Springs, a Center of ASU-Beebe, was officially estab-
lished by Act 426 of 1999 in response to the community’s desire to 
have a two-year college presence in Cleburne County.   
 
Effective July 1, 2003, Foothills Technical Institute in Searcy 
merged with ASU-Beebe to become ASU-Searcy, a Technical 
Campus of ASU-Beebe.   
 
Mountain Home 
In 1991, the Arkansas General Assembly created Mountain Home 
Technical College through the merger of Baxter County Communi-
ty/Technical Center and the North Arkansas Community/Technical 
Center in Mountain Home.  On October 19, 1993, the voters of 
Baxter County authorized the levy of a two mill tax to support oper-
ations at the Arkansas State University-Mountain Home campus.  
The institution was designated Arkansas State University-Mountain 
Home in 1995. 
 
Newport 
Under the provisions of Ark. Code Ann. § 6-53-405, White River 
Technical College was consolidated with Arkansas State University
-Beebe campus effective July 1, 1992 and named Arkansas State 
University-Newport.  Subsequently, the Newport campus separated 
itself from Beebe to become a stand-alone campus.   
 
Effective July 1, 2001, Delta Technical Institute was merged to the 
University to become the Arkansas State University Technical Cen-
ter.  The Technical Center is part of the Newport campus and con-
sists of two campuses located at Marked Tree and Jonesboro. 
 
Mid-South 
Mid-South Vocational Technical School, an institution of higher 
education of the State of Arkansas and located in West Memphis, 
began operations January 18, 1982.  Effective July 1, 1991, the 
College's name was changed to Mid-South Technical College under 
the provision of Ark. Code Ann. § 6-53-301.  On February 16, 
1993, the voters approved a four mill property tax for the creation 
of the community college.  During April 1993, the Arkansas State 
Board of Higher Education approved the change in status of Mid-

South Technical College to Mid-South Community College.  Effec-
tive July 1, 2015 under the provisions of Ark. Code Ann. § 6-60-
102, Mid-South Community College merged with the Arkansas 
State System to become Arkansas State University-Mid-South. 
 
Three Rivers 
Ouachita Vocational Technical School began operations in January 
1972.  Effective July 1, 1991, the entity’s name was changed to 
Ouachita Technical College under the provisions of Act 617 of 
1991.  The College became under the jurisdiction of the Arkansas 
State Board of Higher Education.  On March 8, 2011, Act 208 of 
2011 was approved changing the name of the entity to College of 
the Ouachitas effective July 27, 2011.  Effective January 1, 2020 
under the provisions of Ark. Code Ann. § 6-60-102, College of the 
Ouachitas merged with the Arkansas State University System to 
become Arkansas State University Three Rivers. 
 
System 
In 1998, the Arkansas State University Board of Trustees approved 
the recognition and designation of the Arkansas State University 
System to encompass the campuses and locations. 
 
The Arkansas State University System is governed by the Board of 
Trustees, which consists of five persons appointed by the Governor 
of the State of Arkansas.  Terms of appointments are for five years 
and Board members may be re-appointed by the Governor for a 
second five year term.   
 
Component Units 
Arkansas State University System Foundation, Inc. 
The Arkansas State University System Foundation, Inc. (the ASU 
Foundation) is a legally separate, tax-exempt component unit of 
Arkansas State University (the University).  The ASU Foundation 
acts primarily as a fund-raising and asset management organization 
to develop and supplement the resources that are available to the 
University in support of its mission and programs.  The 33 member 
board of the ASU Foundation is self-perpetuating and consists of 
graduates and friends of the University.  Although the University 
does not control the timing or amount of receipts from the ASU 
Foundation, the majority of resources, or income thereon, which the 
ASU Foundation holds and invests are restricted to the activities of 
the University by donors.  Because these restricted resources held 
by the ASU Foundation may only be used by, or for the benefit of 
the University, the ASU Foundation is considered a component unit 
of the University under the guidelines established by Governmental 
Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement no. 39, Determin-
ing Whether Certain Organizations are Component Units.  Accord-
ingly, the financial statements of the ASU Foundation are discretely 
presented in the University’s financial statements in accordance 
with the provisions of GASB Statement no. 39.   
 
During the year ended June 30, 2020, the ASU Foundation trans-
ferred property, equipment and funds of $2,698,188 to the Universi-
ty for academic support.  Complete financial statements for the 
ASU Foundation may be obtained from the ASU Foundation at 
P.O. Box 1990, State University, AR  72467-1990.   
 
The ASU Foundation reports under the requirements of the Not-for 
Profit Organizations Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards 
Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification.  As such, cer-
tain revenue recognition criteria and presentation features are differ-
ent from GASB revenue recognition criteria and presentation fea-
tures.  No modifications have been made to the ASU Foundation’s 
financial information in the University’s financial statements.  
 
Arkansas State University Red Wolves Foundation, Inc. 
The Arkansas State University Red Wolves Foundation, Inc. (the 
RW Foundation) is a legally separate, tax-exempt component unit 
of Arkansas State University (the University).  The RW Foundation 
is dedicated to aid, assist, and promote the development of intercol-
legiate athletics at the Jonesboro campus and to work with the Uni-

versity’s administration in serving the institution.  The RW Founda-
tion’s support comes primarily through donor contributions.  The 
RW Foundation is considered a component unit of the University 
under the guidelines established by Governmental Accounting 
Standards Board (GASB) Statement no. 39, Determining Whether 
Certain Organizations are Component Units.  Accordingly, the fi-
nancial statements of the RW Foundation are discretely presented in 
the University’s financial statements in accordance with the provi-
sions of GASB Statement no. 39.   
 
During the year ended June 30, 2020, the RW Foundation trans-
ferred property, equipment and funds of $2,487,537 to the Universi-
ty for support.  Complete financial statements for the RW Founda-
tion may be obtained from the RW Foundation at P.O. Box 2219, 
State University, AR  72467-1990.   
 
The RW Foundation reports under the requirements of the Not-for 
Profit Organizations Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards 
Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification.  As such, cer-
tain revenue recognition criteria and presentation features are differ-
ent from GASB revenue recognition criteria and presentation fea-
tures.  No modifications have been made to the RW Foundation’s 
financial information in the University’s financial statements.  
 
Financial Statement Presentation 
In June 1999, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board 
(GASB) issued Statement no. 34, Basic Financial Statements - and 
Management Discussion and Analysis - for State and Local Govern-
ments. GASB Statement no. 35, Basic Financial Statements - and 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis - for Public Colleges and 
Universities, followed this in November 1999.  The financial state-
ment presentation required by GASB no. 34 and no. 35 provides a 
comprehensive, entity-wide perspective of the University’s assets, 
liabilities, net position, revenues, expenses, changes in net position 
and cash flows. 
 
In June 2011, the GASB issued Statement no. 63, Financial Report-
ing of Deferred Outflows of Resources, Deferred Inflows of Re-
sources, and Net Position.  This statement provides financial report-
ing guidance for deferred outflows of resources and deferred in-
flows of resources.   The use of net position as the residual of all 
other elements presented in a statement of financial position has 
also been identified.  This statement amends the net asset reporting 
requirement in Statement no. 34 and other pronouncements by in-
corporating deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of 
resources into the definitions of the required components of the 
residual measure and by renaming that measure as net position, 
rather than net assets. 
 
In March 2012, the GASB issued Statement no. 65, Items Previous-
ly Reported as Assets and Liabilities.  This statement is related to 
Statement no. 63 in that it establishes accounting and financial re-
porting standards that reclassify, as deferred outflows of resources 

or deferred inflows of resources, certain items that were previously 
reported as assets and liabilities and recognizes, as outflows of re-
sources or inflows of resources, certain items that were previously 
reported as assets and liabilities.   
 
In June 2012, the GASB issued Statement no. 68, Accounting and 
Financial Reporting for Pensions.  The primary objective of this 
Statement is to improve accounting and financial reporting by state 
and local governments for pensions.  It also improves information 
provided by state and local governmental employers about financial 
support for pensions that is provided by other entities.     
 
In June 2015, the GASB issued Statement no. 75, Accounting and 
Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pen-
sions. This Statement revises existing standards for measuring and 
reporting retiree benefits provided by the University to its employ-
ees. 
 
In March 2016, the GASB issued Statement no. 81, Irrevocable 
Split-Interest Agreements. Although the effective date of the Stand-
ard is for fiscal year 2018, the University early implemented the 
requirements of the Standard in accounting for an irrevocable split-
interest agreement at the Jonesboro campus in fiscal year 2017. 
 
In May 2020, the GASB issued Statement no. 95, Postponement of 
the Effective Dates of Certain Authoritative Guidance.  This State-
ment postpones the following Statements that are relevant to the 
University due to the COVID-19 pandemic:  Statement no. 84 Fidu-
ciary Activities, Statement no. 89, Accounting for Interest Cost 
Incurred before the End of a Construction Period, and Statement no. 
87, Leases. 
 

Basis of Accounting 
For financial reporting purposes, the University is considered a 
special-purpose government engaged only in business-type activi-
ties.  Accordingly, the University’s financial statements have been 
presented using the economic resources focus and the accrual basis 
of accounting.  Under the accrual basis, revenues are recognized 
when earned, and expenses are recorded when an obligation is in-
curred.   
 
The consolidated University financial statements were prepared 
from the separate statements of the six (6) campuses.  Financial 
transactions among the campuses were not considered material in 
amount or consequence and, accordingly, were not eliminated from 
the consolidated statements.   
 

Capital Assets and Depreciation 
Land, buildings, improvements and infrastructure, equipment, audi-
ovisual holdings and construction in progress are recorded at cost at 
the date of acquisition or acquisition value at the date of donation in 
the case of gifts.  Livestock held for educational purposes is record-

ed at cost or estimated acquisition value.  Library holdings are rec-
orded at cost or a stated rate per volume.  For the campuses that 
record library holdings at a stated rate per volume, the additions for 
the fiscal year are displayed as a separate line item on the Statement 
of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Position.  Library hold-
ings that are capitalized do not include periodicals, microfilm, mi-
crofiche and government documents.  The University follows capi-
talization guidelines established by the State of Arkansas.  The Uni-
versity’s capitalization policy for equipment is to record, as assets, 
any items with a unit cost of more than $5,000 and an estimated 
useful life greater than one year.  Improvements to buildings, infra-
structure, and land that significantly increase the value or extend the 
useful life of the asset are capitalized.  Routine repairs and mainte-
nance are charged to operating expense when incurred.  Interest 
costs incurred are no longer capitalized during the period of con-
struction.  The University early implemented GASB Statement no. 
89, Accounting for Interest Cost Incurred before the End of a Con-
struction Period, during fiscal year 2019.  This statement was effec-
tive for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, but 
was postponed by one year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
At the Jonesboro campus, depreciation is calculated using the 
straight-line method over the estimated lives of the assets, generally 
50 years for buildings, 30 years for residence halls, 20 years for 
improvements and infrastructure, 15 years for library and audiovis-
ual holdings, 10 years for leasehold improvements, and 3 to 7 years 
for equipment.  Capital assets are presented net of accumulated 
depreciation where applicable.  Depreciation is begun the fiscal 
year following the date of acquisition.  No depreciation is taken the 
year of disposal.  
 
At the Mid-South campus, depreciation is calculated using the 
straight-line method over the estimated lives of the assets, generally 
50 years for buildings, 20 years for mobile classrooms and metal 
structures, 20 years for improvements and infrastructure, 15 years 
for library and audiovisual holdings, and 5 to 15 years for equip-
ment.  Capital assets are presented net of accumulated depreciation 
where applicable.  Depreciation is started in the month of acquisi-
tion.  No depreciation is taken the year of disposal. 
 
At the Three Rivers campus, depreciation is calculated using the 
straight-line method over the estimated lives of the assets, generally 
20 to 50 years for buildings, 10 to 40 years for improvements and 
infrastructure, 15 years for library and audiovisual holdings, and 5 
to 20 years for equipment.  Capital assets are presented net of accu-
mulated depreciation where applicable.  Depreciation is started in 
the month of acquisition.  Depreciation is taken in the year of dis-
posal for equipment only. 
 
For all other campuses, depreciation is calculated using the straight-
line method over the estimated lives of the assets, generally 15 to 30 
years for buildings, 15 years for improvements and infrastructure, 
10 years for library and audiovisual holdings, and 3 to 20 years for 
equipment.  Capital assets are presented net of accumulated depre-
ciation where applicable.  Depreciation is begun the fiscal year 
following the date of acquisition.  No depreciation is taken the year 
of disposal.  
 
Easements are considered intangible assets and are capitalized at 
either the cost at the date of acquisition or acquisition value at the 
date of donation in the case of gifts. 
 
Software costing $1,000,000 or more is capitalized as an intangible 
asset and is amortized over the life of the software.  
 
Operating and Nonoperating Revenues 
Revenues of the University are classified as either operating or 
nonoperating according to the following criteria:   

 
Operating Revenues:  Operating revenues result from 
activities that have characteristics of exchange transac-

tions; that is, the University receives payment in exchange 
for providing services or products to students or other 
constituencies.  Student tuition and fees, net of scholar-
ship discounts and allowances, sales and services of auxil-
iary operations, net of scholarship discounts and allow-
ances, and most federal, state, local, and private grants are 
the main categories of operating revenues for the Univer-
sity.   
 
Nonoperating Revenues:  Nonoperating revenues are 
those revenues that result from nonexchange transactions 
or from activities specifically defined as nonoperating by 
the GASB.  Examples of nonoperating revenues include 
state appropriations, certain grants and contracts, sales 
and use taxes, property taxes, and investment income.  
State appropriations from the state are considered nonop-
erating under the definitions set forth by the GASB be-
cause the University does not provide a direct and com-
mensurate benefit to the legislature in exchange for them.   
 

Cash Equivalents 
For purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows, the University con-
siders all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 
three months or less to be cash equivalents.  
 
Accounts Receivable 
Accounts receivable consists of assets the University is legally enti-
tled to, but for which payment has not been received as of the close 
of the fiscal year at June 30, 2020.  The various sources of the Uni-
versity’s receivables are detailed in a subsequent note.  Receivables 
are presented net of any estimated uncollectible amounts in accord-
ance with generally accepted accounting principles.    
 
Investments 
An investment is a security or other asset that (a) a government 
holds primarily for the purpose of income or profit and (b) has a 
present service capacity based solely on its ability to generate cash 
or be sold to generate cash.  The University accounts for its invest-
ments, except for nonparticipating contracts, at fair value in accord-
ance with GASB Statement no. 72, Fair Value Measurement and 
Application.  Fair value is the defined as the price that would be 
received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly

transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  
Changes in unrealized gain (loss) on the carrying value of invest-
ments are reported as a component of investment income in the 
Statement of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Position.  
Nonparticipating contracts are reported at cost in accordance with 
GASB Statement no. 31, Accounting and Reporting for Certain 
Investments and for External Investment Pools.   
 
The University’s policy is to report all endowment funds adminis-
tered by other parties for investment purposes as investments in the 
financial statements.   
 
Detailed information of the University’s investments is provided in 
Note 2. 
 

Inventories 
Inventories are valued at cost with cost being generally determined 
on a first-in, first-out or average basis. 
 

Noncurrent Cash and Investments 
Cash and investments that are externally restricted for endowment 
scholarships and other purposes or to purchase or construct capital 
assets, are classified as noncurrent assets in the Statement of Net 
Position.  Additionally, this classification includes other long-term 
investments with original maturity dates greater than one year.   

 
Restricted/Unrestricted Resources 
The University has no formal policy addressing which resources to 
use when both restricted and unrestricted net position are available 
for the same purpose.  University personnel decide which resources 
to use at the time expenses are incurred. 
 

Unearned Revenues 
Unearned revenues consist primarily of amounts received prior to 
the end of the fiscal year for tuition and fees and certain auxiliary 
activities that relate to a subsequent accounting period.  For exam-
ple, payments for tuition and fees for the second summer term or 
season football tickets for the upcoming fall season received prior 
to June 30, 2020 are treated as unearned revenues.  They are consid-
ered liabilities of the University until earned.   
 
Compensated Absences Payable 
Employee vacation, sick leave, and compensatory time earned, but 
not paid, and related matching costs are recorded as a liability and 
expense on the University’s financial statements as required by 
generally accepted accounting principles.  An estimate is made to 
allocate this liability between its current and noncurrent compo-
nents.   
 
Deposits with Trustees 
Deposits with trustees are externally restricted and held by various 
banks for the University.  They are maintained in order to make 

debt service payments, to maintain sinking or reserve funds as re-
quired by bond covenants, or to purchase or construct capital assets.   
 
Noncurrent Liabilities 
Noncurrent liabilities include (1) principal amounts of bonds paya-
ble, notes payable, and capital lease obligations with contractual 
maturities greater than one year; (2) estimated amounts for accrued 
compensated absences and related matching costs and other liabili-
ties that will not be paid within the next fiscal year; (3) estimated 
amounts for deposits held that will not be paid within the next fiscal 
year; (4) other postemployment benefits (Note 12); (5) net pension 
liability (Note 8); and (6) the refundable federal portion of the Per-
kins Loan Program.   
 
Pensions 
For purposes of measuring the net pension liability, deferred out-
flows of resources and deferred inflows of resources related to pen-
sions, and pension expense, information about the fiduciary net 
position of the Arkansas Public Employees Retirement System 
(APERS) and Arkansas Teacher Retirement System (ARTRS) and 
additions to/deductions from their respective fiduciary net position 
have been determined on the same basis as they are reported by 
each retirement system.  For this purpose, benefit payments 
(including refunds of employee contributions) are recognized when 
due and payable in accordance with the benefit terms.  Investments 
are reported at fair value. 
 
Property Taxes 
The Mid-South and Mountain Home campuses receive property tax 
revenues.  These property taxes are levied in November based on 
property assessment made between January 1 and May 31 and are 
an enforceable lien on January 1 for real property and June 1 for 
personal property.  The tax records are opened on the first business 
day of March of the year following the levy date and are considered 
delinquent after October 15 of the same calendar year.   
 

Sales and Use Taxes 
Effective January 2003, the electors of Jackson County, by a major-
ity vote, approved the levy of a one-half of one percent (1/2%) sales 
and use tax for the ASU-Newport campus.  This tax will be utilized 
for capital improvements and operation and maintenance.  Addi-
tionally, the electors of Cleburne County approved the levy of a one
-half of one percent (1/2%) sales and use tax for the Heber Springs 
campus.  The tax will also be utilized for capital improvements and 
operation and maintenance.   
 

Funds Held in Trust for Others 
The University holds deposits as custodian or fiscal agent for stu-
dents, student organizations, and certain other organized activities 
related to the University.   
 

Net Position 
The University’s net position is classified as follows:     
 
Net Investment in Capital Assets:  This classification represents the 
University’s total investment in capital assets, net of outstanding 
debt obligations related to those assets.  To the extent debt has been 
incurred but not yet expended for capital assets, such amounts are 
not included in this category.   

 
Restricted Net Position:  Within this classification there are two (2) 
categories of net position:   

 

 Restricted, expendable:  Restricted expendable net position 
includes resources for which the University is legally or con-
tractually obligated to spend only in accordance with re-
strictions imposed by external parties.   
 



50  

ARKANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM 
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

JUNE 30, 2020 

 

 
 Restricted, nonexpendable:  Nonexpendable restricted net posi-

tion consists of endowment and similar type funds for which 
donors or other external parties have stipulated that the princi-
pal or corpus is to be maintained inviolate and in perpetuity 
and invested only for the purpose of producing income which 
may either be expended in accordance with the donors’ or 
external parties’ stipulations or added to the principal.   

 
Unrestricted Net Position:  Unrestricted net position represents 
resources of the University that are unrelated to capital items and 
not externally restricted.  These resources may be expended at the 
discretion of the University’s governing board in the educational 
and general operations of the University and in furtherance of its 
mission.   
 

Scholarship Discounts and Allowances 
Student tuition and fees, and certain other revenues received from 
students are reported net of scholarship discounts and allowances in 
the Statement of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Position.  
Scholarship discounts and allowances are the difference between 
the University’s stated rates and charges and the amount actually 
paid by students and/or third parties making payments on behalf of 
the students.  Under this approach, scholarships awarded by the 
University are considered as reductions in tuition and fee revenues 
rather than as expenses.  Additionally, certain governmental grants, 
such as Pell grants, and payments from other federal, state or non-
governmental programs, are required to be recorded as either oper-
ating or nonoperating revenues in the University’s financial state-
ments.  To the extent that revenues from such programs are applied 
to tuition, fees, and other student charges, the University has report-
ed a corresponding scholarship discount or allowance.

The above deposits do not include cash on deposit in the state treasury and cash on hand maintained by the University in the amounts of $6,118,576 
and $70,010 at June 30, 2020, respectively.  Also, the above amount does not include $100,727 in cash and cash equivalents and $400,000 in certif-
icates of deposits held by the ASU Foundation for license plate scholarships classified as short-term investments and $56,053 of money market 
funds classified as cash and cash equivalents.  The above total deposits include certificates of deposits of $17,446,307 reported as investments and 
classified as nonnegotiable certificates of deposit and money market checking accounts of $110 reported as deposits with trustees.  Additionally, the 
deposits do not include money market checking accounts of $1,836 reported as deposits with trustees. 
 

Custodial Credit Risk - Deposits  
Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the event of a bank failure, the University’s deposits may not be returned to it.  The University’s policy states

Refunding of Debt 
 
Jonesboro 
On December 18, 2019, the University issued $1,640,000 in tax exempt refunding bonds for the Jonesboro campus with interest rates of 2 to 3 per-
cent to refund $1,605,000 of outstanding bonds, with an unamortized discount of $5,681, dated December 7, 2010 with interest rates of 2 to 4.125 
percent.  Net proceeds of $1,625,023 after payment of $40,581 for bond issuance costs and a premium of $25,604 were remitted to an escrow agent 
to provide for all future payments of the defeased bonds.  Additionally, $38 was transferred from the debt service reserve of the 2010 issue.  U.S. 
Treasury obligations of $1,622,947 purchased by the escrow agent, were pledged for the retirement of these bonds.  As a result of this refunding, 
the 2010 Series bonds are considered to be defeased and the liability for those bonds has been removed from the Statement of Net Position.  The 
2010 bonds were called on December 18, 2019.   The University refunded the bonds to reduce its total debt service payments by $140,209 over the 
next eleven (11) years and to obtain an economic gain of $110,272.  The refunding resulted in a difference between the reacquisition price and the 
net carrying amount of the old debt of $38,292. This difference, reported in the accompanying financial statements as a deferred outflow of re-
sources, will be amortized through the year 2030 using the straight-line method.  Additionally, the 2010 Series had an unamortized difference be-
tween the reacquisition price and the net carrying amount of $34,605.  This will continue to be amortized through the year 2030 using the straight-
line method. 
 
On December 18, 2019, the University issued $3,750,000 in taxable refunding bonds for the Jonesboro campus with interest rates of 2.004 to 3.651 
percent to refund $3,905,000 of outstanding bonds dated December 1, 2012 with interest rates of 0.866 to 4.7 percent.  Net proceeds of $3,678,036 
after payment of $71,964 for bond issuance costs were remitted to an escrow agent to provide for all future payments of the defeased bonds.  Addi-
tionally, $3,960 was transferred from the debt service reserve of the 2012 issue.  U.S. Treasury obligations of $3,678,036 purchased by the escrow 
agent, were pledged for the retirement of these bonds.  As a result of this refunding, the 2012 Series bonds are considered to be defeased and the 
liability for those bonds has been removed from the Statement of Net Position.  The 2012 bonds were called on December 18, 2019.   The Universi-
ty refunded the bonds to reduce its total debt service payments by $629,014 over the next twenty-three (23) years and to obtain an economic gain of 
$511,435.  The refunding resulted in a difference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying amount of the old debt of $78,152. This dif-
ference, reported in the accompanying financial statements as a deferred outflow of resources, will be amortized through the year 2042 using the 
straight-line method.   
 
Mountain Home 
On December 18, 2019, the University issued $4,885,000 in taxable refunding bonds for the Mountain Home campus with interest rates of 2.004 to 
3.119 percent to refund $4,785,000 of outstanding bonds dated December 1, 2012 with interest rates of 0.666 to 4.25 percent.  Net proceeds of 
$4,794,248 after payment of $90,752 for bond issuances costs were remitted to an escrow agent to provide for all future payments of the defeased 
bonds.  Additionally,  $151 was transferred from the debt service reserve of the 2012 issue.  U.S. Treasury obligations of $4,793,491, purchased by 
the escrow agent, were pledged for the retirement of these bonds.  As a result of this refunding the 2012 Series bonds are considered to be defeased 
and the liability for those bonds has been removed from the Statement of Net Position.  The 2012 bonds were called on December 18, 2019.  The 
University refunded the bonds to reduce its total debt service payments by $305,477 over the next thirteen (13) years and to obtain an economic 
gain of $256,586.  The refunding resulted in a difference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying amount of the old debt of $50,502.  
This difference reported in the accompanying financial statements as a deferred outflow of resources, will be amortized through the year 2032 using 
the straight-line method.  Additionally, the 2012 Series had an unamortized difference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying amount 
of $16,633.  This will continue to be amortized through the year 2032 using the straight-line method.

Benefits Provided 
 
Arkansas Teacher Retirement System 
Benefit provisions are set forth in Arkansas Code Annotated, Chapter 24 and may only be amended by the Arkansas General Assembly.  ATRS 
provides retirement, disability and death benefits.  Members are eligible for full retirement benefits at age 60 with five or more years of credited 
service or at any age with 28 or more years of credited service.  Members with 25 years of credited service who have not attained age 60 may re-
ceive an annuity reduced by 5/12 of 1% multiplied by the number of months by which the early retirement precedes the earlier of (1) completion of 
28 years of credited service or (2) attainment of age 60.  The normal retirement benefit, paid monthly, is determined based on (1) the member’s 
final average salary (effective April 1, 1998, computed using highest three years salary) and (2) the number of years of service.   
 
Disability retirement benefits are payable to members who are vested and demonstrate total and permanent incapacity to perform the duties of their 
position while in active employment. The disability annuity is computed in the same manner as the age and service annuity. 
 
Survivor benefits are payable to qualified survivors upon the death of an active, vested member. Eligible spouse survivors receive a survivor annui-
ty that is based on the member’s years of service credit prior to their death, and minor child survivors receive a percentage of the member’s highest 
salary earned.  ATRS also provides a lump sum death benefit for active and retired members with 10 years of actual service. The amount for con-
tributory members will be up to $10,000 and up to $6,667 for noncontributory members. The amount will be prorated for members who have both 
contributory and noncontributory service. Members with 15 or more years of contributory service will receive the full $10,000. 
 
A cost of living adjustment (COLA) is payable on July 1 of each year to retirees, certain survivors, and annuity beneficiaries who received monthly 
benefits for the previous 12 months. The COLA is calculated by multiplying 100% of the member’s base retirement annuity by 3%. 
 
Act 1096 of 1995 created a teacher deferred retirement option plan (T-DROP) for members with 30 or more years of service credits. Act 1590 of 
1999 allows for participation in the T-DROP after 28 years of credited service with a reduction of 6% for each year under 30 years. Effective Sep-
tember 1, 2003, Act 992 of 2003 requires employers to make contributions on behalf of all members participating in T-DROP at rates established 
by the Board of Trustees.  Member election to enter T-DROP is irrevocable, and additional service credit cannot be accumulated. During participa-
tion in T-DROP, ATRS will credit the member account with plan deposits and interest. The plan deposits are the member’s normal retirement bene-
fit reduced by 1% for each year of service. For members who entered T-DROP prior to September 1, 2003, the reduction is 1/2 of 1% (.5%) for 
contributory service and 3/10 of 1% (.3%) for noncontributory service for each year above 30 years of service. The T-DROP account accrues inter-
est at a variable rate that is set annually by the ATRS Board of Trustees.  T-DROP deposits into member accounts cease at the completion of 10 
years of participation in the program; however, a member may continue employment and will continue to receive interest on the account balance at 
the 10-year plus interest rate that is also set annually by the Board of Trustees. When T-DROP participation ceases, the member may receive the T-
DROP distribution as a lump-sum cash payment or an annuity or may roll it over into another tax-deferred account. A member may also elect to 
defer all or part of the distribution into a T-DROP cash balance account held by ATRS. 
 
The University no longer offers new employees the option of electing Arkansas Teacher Retirement System as a retirement plan.  Employees who 
had already elected this option will continue to participate in the plan.  This became effective on July 1, 2011 for the Jonesboro, Beebe, Mountain 
Home and Newport campuses.  This was effective for the Mid-South campus on June 8, 2015 and the Three Rivers campus on December 31, 2019. 
 
The University reported payables to ATRS in the amount of $20,721 as of June 30, 2020.  This amount has been reported on the Statement of Net 
Position as a current liability. 
 
Arkansas Public Employees Retirement System 
Benefit provisions are established by state law and may be amended only by the Arkansas General Assembly.  Members are eligible for full bene-
fits under the following conditions: 
At age 65 with 5 years of service, 
At any age with 28 years of actual service, 
At age 60 with 20 years of actual service if under the old contributory plan (prior to July 1, 2005), or 
At age 55 with 35 years of credited service for elected or public safety officials. 
  
The normal retirement benefit amount, paid on a monthly basis, is determined by the member’s final average salary and years of service.  A mem-
ber may retire with a reduced benefit at age 55 with at least five years of actual service or at any age with 25 years of actual service.  APERS also 
provides for disability and survivor benefits. 
 
The University no longer offers new employees the option of electing Arkansas Public Employees Retirement System as a retirement plan.  Em-
ployees who had already elected this option will continue to participate in the plan.  This became effective on January 1, 2012 for the Jonesboro, 
Beebe, Mountain Home and Newport campuses.  This was effective for the Three Rivers campus on December 31, 2019.  The Mid-South campus 
did not participate in this plan.   
 
The University reported payables to APERS in the amount of $65,932 as of June 30, 2020.  This amount has been reported on the Statement of Net 
Position as a current liability. 
 
Contributions 
 
Arkansas Teacher Retirement System 
ATRS has contributory and noncontributory plans. The contributory plan has been in effect since the beginning of ATRS. The noncontributory plan 
became available July 1, 1986.  Act 81 of 1999, effective July 1, 1999, requires all new members to be contributory and allowed active members as 
of July 1, 1999, until July 1, 2000, to make an irrevocable choice to be contributory or noncontributory.  Act 93 of 2007 allows any noncontributory 
member to make an irrevocable election to become contributory on July 1 of each fiscal year. 
 
ATRS’s funding policy provides for periodic employer contributions at statutorily established rates based on annual actuarial valuations. The em-

ployer contribution rate was 14.25% for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2020. Contributory members are required to contribute 6.25% of gross wag-
es to ATRS. Employee contributions are refundable if ATRS-covered employment terminates before a monthly benefit is payable. Employee con-
tributions remaining on deposit with ATRS for a period of one or more years earn interest credits, which are included in the refund. 
 
Arkansas Public Employees Retirement System 
Contribution provisions applicable to the participating employers are established by the Board and based on the actuary’s determination of the rate 
required to fund the plan.  The additional cost of public safety service for public safety employees is determined by the actuary as well. 
 
The System was established as a contributory plan.  However, with the passage of Act 793 of 1977, existing members and previous members were 
offered the opportunity to choose to become non-contributory members.  Anyone who joined the System subsequent to January 1, 1978 and had not 
previously been a member was automatically enrolled as a non-contributory member. 
 
Act 2084, enacted by the 2005 General Assembly, directed APERS to establish a new contributory plan that became effective July 1, 2005.  All 
covered employees first hired on or after July 1, 2005, contribute 5% of their salary into the plan.  Employees hired before June 30, 2005 who were 
in the non-contributory plan were given the option to join the new contributory plan by December 31, 2005.  Non-contributory members who did 
not join the new contributory plan by that deadline remain non-contributory members. 
 
Members may have employee contributions in the System if (a) they were members of APERS on or before January 1, 1978, (b) they are members 
first hired after July 1, 2005, or (c) they have purchased service in the System. 
 
Employee contributions are refundable if APERS-covered employment terminates before a monthly benefit is payable.  Employee contributions 
remaining on deposit with APERS can earn interest (at the rate of 4% per year), which is included in the refund.  Pursuant to the provisions of Act 
625 of 1983 and Act 1097 of 1993, certain agencies employing individuals in public safety positions are required to remit additional contributions 
in amounts determined by an independent actuary. 
 
Employee refunds do not include contributions made by the employers.  Employers contributed 15.32% of compensation for the fiscal year ended 
June 30, 2020.

The collective net pension liability of $6,583,893,847 ($4,171,365,050 related to ATRS and $2,412,528,797 related to APERS) was measured as of 
June 30, 2019, and the total pension liability used to calculate the net pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation as of that date.  
Each employer’s proportion of the net pension liability was based on the employer’s share of contributions to the pension plan relative to the total 
contributions of all participating employers. 
 
At June 30, 2020, the University reported a liability of $17,977,195 ($11,226,933 related to ATRS and $6,750,262 related to APERS) for its pro-
portionate share of the net pension liability.  At June 30, 2019, the University’s proportion of the collective net pension liability was .27% for 
ATRS and .28% for APERS. 
 
For the year ended June 30, 2020, the University recognized total pension expense of $1,599,161.  $923,153 of this amount was related to ATRS 
and $676,008 was related to APERS.  At June 30, 2020, the University reported deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources 
related to pensions from the following sources: 

The above amount of $1,841,825 was reported as deferred outflows of resources related to pensions resulting from University contributions subse-
quent to the measurement date and will be recognized as a reduction of the net pension liability in the year ended June 30, 2021.  Other amounts 
reported as deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources related to pensions will be recognized in pension expense as follows:

Investment Rate of Return 
The investment rate of return was developed for each plan as follows: 
 
Arkansas Teacher Retirement System 
The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using a building-block method in which best-estimate ranges of 
expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net of pension plan investment expense and inflation) are developed for each major class. 
These ranges are combined to produce the long-term expected rate of return by weighting the expected future real rates of return by the target asset 
allocation percentage and by adding expected inflation. Best estimates of geometric real rates of return were adopted by the plan’s trustees after 
considering input from the plan’s investment consultant and actuary.  
 
For each major asset class that is included in the pension plan’s target asset allocation as of June 30, 2019, these best estimates are summarized in 
the following table:

Discount Rate 
Arkansas Teacher Retirement System 
A single discount rate of 7.50% was used to measure the total pension liability. This single discount rate was based on the expected rate of return on 
pension plan investments of 7.50%. The projection of cash flows used to determine this single discount rate assumed that plan member contribu-
tions will be made at the current contribution rate and that employer contributions will be 14% of payroll. Based on these assumptions, the pension 
plan’s fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all projected future benefit payments of current plan members. Therefore, the 
long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pen-
sion liability. 
 
Arkansas Public Employees Retirement System 
A single discount rate of 7.15% was used to measure the total pension liability.  This single discount rate was based on the expected rate of return 
on pension plan investments of 7.15%.  The projection of cash flows used to determine this single discount rate assumed that plan member contri-
butions will be made at the current contribution rate and that employer contributions will be made at rates equal to the difference between actuarial-
ly determined contribution rates and the member rate.  Based on these assumptions, the pension plan’s fiduciary net position was projected to be 
available to make all projected future benefit payments of current plan members.  Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on pension plan 
investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension liability. 
 
Sensitivity of the Proportionate Share of the Net Pension Liability to Changes in the Discount Rate 
The following presents the proportionate share of the net pension liability using the discount rate, as well as what the net pension liability would be 
if it were calculated using a discount rate that is 1 percentage point lower or 1 percentage point higher than the current rate:

OTHER POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS 
 
Plan Description 
The University’s defined benefit OPEB plan, ASU System OPEB Plan (the Plan), provides postemployment benefits to all employees who official-
ly retire from the University and meet certain age- and service-related requirements. The Plan is a single-employer defined benefit OPEB plan ad-
ministered by the University.  No assets are accumulated in a trust that meets the criteria in paragraph 4 of GASB Statement no. 75.  
 
Benefits Provided 
Employees shall become eligible for early retirement benefits in the calendar year in which the sum of their age (must be at least fifty-five (55)) and 
the number of years of continuous benefits eligible service to the University totals seventy (70).  Certain employees who retiree under a voluntary 
retirement window approved by the Board of Trustees of Arkansas State University are also eligible for benefits.   
 
Employees electing retirement will receive the following benefits:  
 

 Medical benefits – Pre-Medicare benefits are available to retirees and their eligible dependents (if covered at the time the employee retires) 
under the Arkansas Blue Advantage Plan. 

 

 Life insurance benefits – The beneficiary of a retiree who dies prior to age 65 receives an amount equal to 1.5 times the retiree’s final salary 
immediately prior to retirement, rounded to the next highest multiple of $1,000.  The maximum benefit is $50,000.  Benefits are not payable to 
a beneficiary of a retiree who dies after attaining age 65.  Some current retirees from the Mid-South campus are eligible for a life insurance 
benefit of $20,000.  This benefit continues beyond age 65 for the lifetime of the retiree.   

 
Medical contributions are equal to one-half of the total combined employee and employer premium cost.  When a retiree dies or becomes eligible 
for Medicare, spouses may continue coverage until they become eligible for Medicare by paying 100% of the employee plus employer premium 
cost.   
 
No contributions are required for the life insurance benefit. 
 
Employees hired on or after January 1, 2019 are not eligible to receive these postemployment benefits. 
 
Employees Covered by Benefit Terms 
At June 30, 2020, the following employees were covered by the benefit terms: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Total OPEB Liability

NOTE 13. 
SELF INSURANCE PROGRAM 
 
Beginning July 1, 1994, Arkansas State University established a self-funded health benefit plan for employees and their eligible dependents.  All 
campuses of the University participate in the program, which is administered by Arkansas Blue Advantage Administrators.  The ASU Three Rivers 
campus joined the plan on January 1, 2020. 
 
At June 30, 2020, approximately 4,407 active employees, their dependents, former employees and retirees were participating in the program.  Ef-
fective January 1, 2019, the University offers two health plans:  the Classic Plan which uses the Arkansas True-Blue network and a Premium Plan 
which uses the Arkansas True-Blue network and the National Blue Care network.  For those participating in single coverage, the University pays 
84% of the total premium.  The University pays 74% of the total premium for those participating in full family coverage, 70% for those participat-
ing in employee & spouse coverage, and 69% for those participating in employee and children coverage.  Retirees, including early retirees, pay 
50% of their coverage and the University covers the other 50%.  The University does not offer insurance to retirees or their spouses who are eligible 
for Medicare.  A retiree's spouse can continue coverage after the retiree becomes eligible for Medicare at a cost of 100% of the single coverage rate 
until they too are eligible for Medicare. 
 
The University estimates its unpaid health claims liability at June 30, 2020 to be $1,457,300 with Arkansas Blue Advantage Administrators.  This 
liability is established for incurred but not reported medical claims and is based on the calculation prepared by Lockton.  Details of this liability are 
shown below. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The University purchases specific reinsurance to reduce its exposure to large claims.  Anthem is the reinsurance carrier.  Under the specific arrange-
ment, the reinsurance carrier pays for claims for covered employees that exceed $300,000.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Unpaid claims, 7-1-2019 1,674,100$   

Incurred claims during current year 14,113,447   

Total claims 15,787,547

NOTE 14. 
ENDOWMENT FUNDS 
 
Jonesboro 
The University has donor-restricted endowment funds.  Investment income on the amount endowed is restricted for scholarships and other purpos-
es.  All endowment funds are maintained as cash or investments.  Investments reported at fair value, include bonds/fixed income, mutual funds and 
other managed investments.  The endowment net position at June 30, 2020 was $13,873,909.  Of this amount, $12,736,151 was nonexpendable and 
the remaining $1,137,758 was expendable.   
 
State law allows a governing board to expend a portion of the net appreciation in the fair value of the assets over the historic dollar value of the 
fund unless the applicable gift document states otherwise.  State law stipulates that such expenses are to be for the purpose for which the endow-
ment funds were established.   
 
For endowments held by the Arkansas State University Foundation, the University’s policy is for annual expenses from the endowment funds not to 
exceed 4% of the five (5) year average market value as determined at December 31st of the previous year.  In periods with no market value appreci-
ation, the University limits the spending to actual income generated by the endowment fund assets.

ARKANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM 
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

JUNE 30, 2020 

 

NOTE 16. 
RISK MANAGEMENT 
 
The University is exposed to various risks of loss including, but not necessarily limited to torts; theft of, damage to, and destruction of assets; errors 
and omissions; nonperformance of duty; injuries to employees; and natural disasters.  In response to this diverse risk exposure, the University has 
established a comprehensive risk management approach including, where acceptable and prudent, retention of the associated risks to the extent that 
funds are available from general operations or reserves to cover losses.  In those situations where risk retention has been deemed not acceptable or 
prudent, the University has practiced risk transfer through participation in the State of Arkansas’s risk management programs or through the pur-
chase of commercial insurance coverage. 
 
The University participates in the Arkansas Fidelity Bond Trust Fund administered by the Government Bonding Board.  The fund provides cover-
age of actual losses incurred as a result of fraudulent or dishonest acts committed by state officials or employees.  Each loss is limited to $300,000 
with a $2,500 deductible.  Premiums for coverage are remitted by the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration from funds deducted 
from the University’s state treasury funds. 
 
The University secures vehicle insurance coverage through participation in the Arkansas Multi-Agency Insurance Trust Fund administered by the 
Risk Management Division of the Arkansas Insurance Department.  The general objective of the program is to allow participating agencies an af-
fordable means of insuring their vehicle fleets.  The University pays an annual premium for this coverage.  The fund provides a coverage pool, but, 
employs a reinsurance policy to reduce its exposure to large losses. 
 
The University also participates in the Worker’s Compensation Revolving Fund administered by the Arkansas Department of Finance and Admin-
istration.  Premium assessments are determined annually by the Department of Finance and Administration and deducted on a quarterly basis from 
the University’s state treasury funds. 
 
Additional information relating to the state’s insurance plans and funds is available in the State of Arkansas’s Annual Comprehensive Financial 
Report. 
 
The University also purchases commercial property insurance coverage to indemnify against unacceptable losses to buildings and business personal 
property through participation in the Arkansas Multi-Agency Insurance Trust Fund administered by the Risk Management Division of the Arkansas 
Insurance Department.  Decisions concerning the appropriate retention levels and types of coverage are made by the campus administrators.  Dur-
ing the past three fiscal years, no claims have exceeded the amount of coverage.  There have been no significant reductions in insurance coverage 
from the prior year in the major categories of risk.  The University pays an annual premium for this coverage.  The fund provides a coverage pool, 
but, employs a reinsurance policy to reduce its exposure to large losses. 
 
The University secures cyber data liability insurance coverage through participation in the Arkansas Multi-Agency Insurance Trust Fund adminis-
tered by the Risk Management Division of the Arkansas Insurance Department.  The general objective of the program is to allow participating 
agencies an affordable means of insuring their cyber data liability exposure. The University pays an annual premium for this coverage and has a 
$25,000 per occurrence deductible applicable only to the hardware “bricking” coverage of the policy. The insurance plan provides a limited self-
funded risk retention plan, but procures an excess liability policy to reduce its exposure to large losses. 
 
Additional polices purchased by the University include a group accident policy that provides accidental death and dismemberment and accident 
medical expenses coverage for certain categories of participants in intercollegiate sport activities of the university; a business travel policy that 
provides accidental death and dismemberment, medical evacuation and repatriation coverage for individuals traveling on university business; a 
comprehensive K&R policy to cover costs and provide assistance in certain crisis events involving university directors, officers, employees, faculty 
and students; a foreign commercial package policy that provides coverage for foreign commercial general liability, auto liability/physical damage, 
voluntary compensation and employers liability, and foreign travel accident and sickness.

MERGER WITH COLLEGE OF THE OUACHITAS 
 
On February 20, 2019, the Board of Trustees approved an agreement of merger and plan of transition between the ASU System and College of the 
Ouachitas (COTO).  In the merger agreement, College of the Ouachitas became a member of the Arkansas State University System.  The ASU 
System agreed to maintain and oversee operations of College of the Ouachitas, after the merger to be known as Arkansas State University Three

entered into so that COTO was fully merged into the Arkansas State University System, which is the surviving legal institution and will continue to 
be governed by the laws of the State of Arkansas with the ASU System receiving and assuming, upon the date of transfer, the assets and liabilities 
of COTO.  The merger was effective on January 1, 2020.

COVID-19 
 
On March 11, 2020, the Governor of Arkansas issued Executive Order 20-03 declaring an emergency and ordered the Arkansas Department of 
Health to take action to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our financial state-
ments for future reporting periods will depend on certain developments, including the duration and speed of the outbreak and revenue collections – 
all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted.  The financial impact of COVID-19 to the Arkansas State University System is uncertain as of 
the audit report date.

ARKANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM 
REQUIRED SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 

JUNE 30, 2020 

 

Notes to Required Supplementary Information 
 
Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions (OPEB) 
 
NOTE 1: Summary of Significant Information Related to Required Supplementary Schedules 
 
A. Changes in benefit terms 

 Plan changes were made such as the addition of new plan options, an increase in required retiree contributions for former Mid 
South retirees, and the addition of the Three Rivers campus to the valuation. These changes resulted in a liability increase of 
about $1.0 million that was recognized immediately in fiscal 2020 expense as a change in benefit terms. 

 
B. Changes in assumptions 

 The discount rate was updated to reflect recent high-quality municipal bond rates. 

 The mortality projection scales were updated based on recent research by the Society of Actuaries. 

 Healthcare trend rates were updated to reflect anticipated future experience as well as separated for medical and prescription 
drugs. 

 Per capita claim costs and administrative expenses were updated to reflect recent plan experience. 

 Aging factors were updated as well as split for medical and prescription drug benefits. 

 The medical participation assumption was updated to assume 80% of all active employees will elect coverage. 

 A 10% administrative expense load was added to the life insurance benefit. 

 The high-value coverage excise tax was removed from the valuation based on legislation in 2019 repealing the tax. 

 The salary increase assumption was updated based on plan sponsor expectations. 

 A plan selection assumption was added to reflect the availability of multiple plans to the retirees.
