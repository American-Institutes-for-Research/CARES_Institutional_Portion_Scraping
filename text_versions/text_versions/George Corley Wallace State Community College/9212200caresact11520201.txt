Wallace Community College Selma 
CARES Act Funds 

 
• Why did I get this money? 

o The Department of Education has made CARES Act funds available 
to students who incurred expenses as a result of COVID-19 related 
disruptions to their campus operations for the spring 2020 term. In our 
initial round of fund distributions, Wallace Community College Selma 
identified a pool of eligible students that have been adversely affected by 
the COVID-19 related disruptions to normal campus operations. These 
students will receive $800 immediate assistance grant on under Phase 1 
of the distribution process (continue reading for details 
on Phase 2 distributions). 
  

• I got this money as a refund. Does this mean my Wallace Community 
College Selma account balance has been paid off? 

o No. Distribution of CARES Act funds is made directly to students and not 
applied by the College toward any outstanding balances that may still be 
owed by the student. As such, receipt of these funds does not indicate the 
recipient has satisfied their financial obligations to Wallace Community 
College Selma for any debts incurred during the spring 2020 term or any 
terms prior. Please check your current account balance to determine what 
you may still owe. 
  

• Can I use this money to pay off my Wallace Community College Selma 
balance? 

o Yes. Wallace Community College Selma is not authorized to apply 
CARES Act funds toward any outstanding balances that may still be owed 
by a student. However, once the funds are received as a refund, students 
may choose to use the funds to pay off their outstanding account balance. 
  

• Can Wallace Community College Selma just apply the funds to my account 
balance with my approval or permission? 

o No. Federal regulations stipulate that all CARES Act funds must be 
disbursed directly to the student and may not be applied toward 
outstanding balances. To use these funds to pay-off an outstanding 
balance with Wallace Community College Selma, a student must make a 
payment to their account through the Cashier’s Office or online 

via MyWallaceSelma. 

  
• What are the eligibility criteria to qualify for CARES Act funding? 

o Based on guidance provided by the Department of Education, students 
must meet the following eligibility parameters to qualify for CARES Act 
funds: 

▪ Be eligible to participate in programs under Section 484 in Title IV 
of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended. (e.g., be eligible 



0 

to receive federal financial aid funds such as the Pell Grant, 
TEACH Grant, Direct Loans, etc.). 

▪ Not enrolled in an exclusively online program on or prior to March 
13, 2020. 

▪ Be a degree-seeking student enrolled in 1 or more credit hours for 
the Spring 2020 term. 

▪ High school students are not eligible. 
  

• Am I eligible to receive CARES Act funds if I have a terminated Satisfactory 
Academic Progress (SAP) status? 

o No. Guidance issued by the Department of Education indicates that 
students with a terminated SAP status are not eligible for CARES Act fund 
distributions. 
  

• Are Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) students eligible for 
CARES Act funds? 

o No. Guidance issued by the Department of Education indicates that 
students must be eligible to submit a FAFSA in order to qualify for the 
CARES Act funds. This limits eligibility to U.S. Citizens, Permanent 
Residents, or other Title IV eligible non-citizens. 
  

• Are international students eligible for CARES Act funds? 
o No. Guidance issued by the Department of Education indicates that 

students must be eligible to submit a FAFSA in order to qualify for the 
CARES Act funds. This limits eligibility to U.S. Citizens, Permanent 
Residents, or other Title IV eligible non-citizens. 
  

• Do I have to pay this money back? 
o No. Any funds a student receives from the CARES Act will not need to be 

repaid. 
  

• Does this money count against my financial aid package? 
o No. Money from the CARES Act is not considered financial assistance 

under federal statue, nor Department of Education regulations. As such, 
these funds will not impact your eligibility for regular financial aid (e.g., 
grants, scholarships, loans). 
  

• Is money received from the CARES Act considered taxable income? 
o The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has not yet announced how the funds 

will be treated for tax purposes. 
  

• If I received money from Phase 1 ($800) but still have need, can I get more 
money? 

o Possibly. Phase 2 of the Wallace Community College Selma CARES Act 
distribution process will be an application-based funding request process. 
Starting on June 5, 2020 eligible students will be able to request up to $

distribution process will be an application-based funding request process. 
Starting on June 5, 2020 eligible students will be able to request up to $
